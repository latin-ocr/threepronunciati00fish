2 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN.

The vowels i, ο, and u are modified when followed
by a consonant in the same syllable, and the sound. is
the same whether the vowel is long or short. For
instance: —

i in mittit-71 in sit. o in poterat=0 in not.
u in frsictfiszu in tub.

THE CONSONANTS.

These are sounded in the main as in English.

O and q are hardzc in cat ancl 9 in got, before α, 0,
and u.

But. σεε, and 9:j before e, ἰ, y, cce, and oe.

S invariably has the hissing souncl, and never that
of z.

This view of the Continental System is substantially
that given in the Grammar of Bullions and Morris,

edition of 1869.

This is called by some the Latin Method3 by others,
the Restored, or the Reformecl Meth0d; and by others
still, tlie Phonetie Methocl.

SOUNDS OF THE VOWELS.

{iza in father. ozzo in bone, tone.
eze in prey. fizu in rude.
izi in caprice, ravine. y=u in ssu· (French).

Y is found only in Greek words, ancl it was sounded
as an intermediate between the u and the i.
⁴ The short vowels differed from the long, not in the
quality of the sound, but. only in being less prolwzyed.
