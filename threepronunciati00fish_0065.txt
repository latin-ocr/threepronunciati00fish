THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN. 51

What are we to say of this word gingiber, which was
also spelled zinziber —our English ginger? There can
be no doubt that the z was soft, at least if we can trust
Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Fabius. Again, the
Latins sometimes put D for G, showing that it was
soft. chre the Germans ever called the Ghermans?
Why, too, was it ever necessary to spell the Greek chi
with ch, if O had the same hard sound? Why Cheru-
bini, and Chiragra, and Chelidonia, and Chiromantis,
and Chelae, and others? How, too, are we to pro-
nounce words in which c follows w, as excire, excipio,
excerpo, exceptio, etc.? If the c is soft, it is easily
elided3 if hard, this would scarcely be possible. So
again, how are we to explain the fact that such names
as Valentia and Sulpitia are written Valencia and Sul-
picia3 and conditio and solatium appear astcondicio
and solacium?* Again, why spell pulcher with an h,
if pulcer has the same sound?

“ There is still another clear indication that 9 had
not the hard sound in all cases. According to Priscian,

the Emperor Claudius, recognizing the imperfection of ·

the Roman alphabet to express various distinction of
sounds, proposed to introduce three new letters or char-
acters, one of which was called the anti—sigma, which
was formed by reversing one c against another. This
oc represented the function of the Greek psi, and all
three letters were, in the opinion at least of Priscian
and Quintilian, necessary. If, therefore, the sound of
c formed any part of that of psi, it clearly could not
have been hard like ΕΗΓ
