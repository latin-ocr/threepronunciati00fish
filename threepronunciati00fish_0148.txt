134 THE THREE PRoNUNc1AT10NS OF LATIN-

5. The sweeping change advocated by the new pro-
nunciation tends to a complete revolution in the pro-
nunciation of our own language. Professor Thacher‚
onale College, uses the following language: ‘² For, to
speak of Latin words which we have adopted, how long
will Cicero maintain his place in English pronunciation
after the rod shall have banished him from the lips of
all Anglo-Saxon boys and girls who thumb the little
Latin histories of the men of Rome, and shall have
substituted the Classical lece—ka-ro in his place? How
long will Caesar stand against Kaisar, Scipio against
Skee-peeo, Fabricius against Fah-bree-kec-oos‚ Cyrus
against Keeroos, Tacitus against Taketoos‚ and so on
through a long list of proper names which make a
familiar part of our English language. Prima facie
evidence will become preemah fahkeeah evidence, the
quid pro quo, keed pro co3 the 901111181001, a ganee-
oos lokee3 the 1110118 0011801011, a mans conskeeah (o as
in 00110) ; 80111001, skeeleekat3 01 cetera, at katarah.'’

Let υ be pronounced like w, and note the way the
most common expressions will be transformed ε -—

viva voce becomes 1000-100111 wo-kay.

per 0011111111 “ par 1001110-100111.
jure 01101110 “ yoo-ray dee-wee-no.

. jus 010110 “ 31008 lece-wee-luy.
Ι’001110111111 “ 1001ῃο1-00111-100111.
’01001110911101 “ ‘mee—wald νειμ-90041011.

And hopeless confusion is made of the many Latin
words incorporated into English, as 1111·ῑο dulce must be
oo-tee-zay clool-cay ,·

001ἶο, walt-lay.
vice versa, wee-lcay maycr-sah.
