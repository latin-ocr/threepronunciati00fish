108 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATm.

We pronounce here the combinations ae and oe pre-
cisely in the same way, giving them always the sound
of ct in the English word mate. This supposes them to
be combined, as otherwise each letter receives its full
sound. (For example the word aer.) The combina-
tion au is so pronounced as to give their native value
to each of the concurring vowels, but with a slight
stress on the α. The result is a sound almost the
same as that given to the ow in the English word how.
The letter j has always the sound of v in the English
word [eles. The letter c is pronouncesl in the same way
as in Italian. Before the combinations ae and ae, it
retains the sound it has before ‘17 and e. Also the letter
9 is pronouncecl here as it is in Italian. Before the
combination oc, which is not found in Italian, it retains
the softer sound, which it has before e and i. The let-
ter v is pronounced invariably as it is in Italian. The
words, then. which you mentioned as examples (vincit,
Cicero, ssenqz'vcc) are pronounced, as far as the letters
agree, like the Italian words vinciti, Cicerone, and
qenqivct.

Sim— As Ι see by your letter, there is no need of
giving you information as to the way, in general, Latin
aud Greek are pronounced, I limit my explanation to
the way in which we pronounce Latin in our Italian
schools, and particularly the letters and combinations
allucled to in your letter.
