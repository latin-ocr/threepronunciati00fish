While actus carice neminem φἀυαόἰΰ and volenti reon fit

THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. —- Here the sweeping
change becomes even more painfully obvious. For ex-
ample, arteria circumfleaea must be called ahr-my—ree-ah
keer-koom-flakes-ah; vena juyulare‘s, way-nah, yoo-qoo-
lah-rees; medulla oblongyata, may-dool-lah obe-Zone-yah-

culum is a‘n once revolutionized and caricatured by being
pronounced ee-tayer ah tctyer-tee-oh ahd kahr-toom weme-
tree-coo-Zoom. These words have not been selected for
their strangeness, but because they give a fair indication
of the confusion that the so-called Roman would intro-
duce into this learned profession. Who can believe that
physicians in England and America will adopt such an
innovation Ρ

So far for Anatomy and Physiology; but Materia
Medica demands a notice.
