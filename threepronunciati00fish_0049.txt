THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN. 35

And, aster all, the reformers os Latin pronunciation,
who wage a war of extermination on nearly every page,
parade their transliterations of Latin into Greek and
Greek into Latin. We repeat that when they compare
Latin and Greek letters, they are comparing two un-

who adopts the Roman mode, used this language in
substance: In conclusion, the speaker urged that, as
