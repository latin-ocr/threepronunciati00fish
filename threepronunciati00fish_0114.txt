100 ΤΗΕ THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN.

Latin as a medium of conversation with Continental
scholam, can adopt their pronunciation in five minutes.
I have had to talk Latin with patois-spealzing cures

and spend your time in clearer teaching of the idioms
and syntax of the flexible, terse old language, and in
a hig-her treatment of its literary wealth.

The “ cadosa felicitas '' of Horace does not depend
on pronunciation, and Virgil will not become “nume-

or lecturers venture upon it in dealing with their classes ;
nor have Ι heard that Cambridge has been more enter-
prising. I regard our syllabus as having fallen still-
born.'’
