68 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN.

classical corruptions, and as being preferable in prac-
tice to such intermediate sounds as English organs do
not easily make.''* Here the want of harmony insisted
on, is confessed‚ and a change in practice is frankly
admitted. How does Prof. W. G. Richardson meet
the difficulty? Here is his answer: “ Oe is not worth a
pinch of N apoleon’s snuff‚ especially since our revised
orthography has expunged it from those oft-recurring
words coelum, poenitet, coena, etc.'' Truly, this modern
Alexander wields a Damascus blade in cutting his
Gordian knots in the Latin pronunciation. If the
reformers can only eliminate oe from the language, then
truly this one difficulty has been removed. Will Mayor
and Roby‚ Haldeman and Blair, and others, meet a
difficulty in this way? We venture a decisive negative.
But Prof. Richardson (“ Courier Journal,'' April)
says: ‘⁴ Abrand-new type of philology has been let
loose on this planet, a thing of life and Joy forever.''
Yes, and an infinite pity it has been let loose at all, if
it proposes to remove difficulties in the way indicated
above. This accomplished linguist does not propose
to settle all disputed questions in this manner. It
may be, however, that this is a philological pleasantry.
The truth of history entitles us to expect of antiquari-
ans that the monuments of the past shall not be mutila-
ted or transmuted so as to respond to modern notions,
as thereb y their actual value as teaching monuments is
destroyed. ῃ
Schliemann does not venture to change the relics he
finds in Hissarlik or Mycenae, but simply reports them
as they are, whether he understands them or not.
