130 ΤΗΕ THREE PRONUNCIATIONS oF LATIN.

in the Latin tongue. (Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Vol.
II. p. 15.) Since English was made the language of
the cour-ts, a vast number of technical terms and
phrases, in the original Latin, have continued in use.
The law books abound with them. Ever since the
Tudor age, the great J'urists in England have used the
English pronunciation in their pleading. They do it
‘co-day. For generations the same has been true in
America. WVebster, Everett, Choate, and others knew
no other in their practice. If Blackstone were in court
‘co-day, and some jurist should call for a scire facias and
pronounce it εἷκε-γαν] sah-kee-ahS, he would be puzzled ;
or if the pleader should quote the maxim, vicarius non
habet vicarium, and pronounce it wee-kah-ree-ofis ηὸηε
‚hah-bac zoee-kalc-ree-ootn, he would never recognize the
maxim. The Roman pronunciation would confuse
every English court in the world, if for no other reason
because it is so totally at variance with established
usage. In law, then, consistency requires the old
mode.

As a further illustration of the change the so—called
Roman method would make in the legal profession,
take certiorari, which becomes kayer-tEe-b-rah-ree;
capias ad satisfaciendum becomes kctlt—pee-ahs alzd sah-
