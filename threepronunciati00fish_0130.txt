’116 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONs oF LATIN.

liei-caster. Now we are concerned with the vernacular.
Prof. Halcleman says, “ Sounds and not letters furnish
the material for etymolog-5³3⁹* This is true, ancl we
wish no better basis for our present argument. The
English methocl assists the student, even in his early
Latin course, in his etymology3 and the derivation of
worcls,in a multitude of instances, becomes manifest
from the very pronunciation itself. 'Pake the word
circumjacent, for example, from circumjaceO. Pro-
nouncing this word by the English method, sur-cum-
jcc-se-o, at once reveals to the pupil the origin of cir-
cumjacent. The likeness is clear even to a child.

But pronounce the same word by the Roman
system, and cwcumy'acefo becomes keer-koom-yah-ke-o!
The connection can be seen only by advanced scholars,
ancl is very likely not seen then. Take the words ‘rup-
ture, rustic, social', rumination, from ruptum, rusticus,
socius, ancl ruminatio. When these Latin words are
pronouncesl by the English mode the origin of the word,
is clear3 but let the Latin be pronounced roop-toom,
γοοδ-1636003, so-lcee-ooss, and roo-mee-nah-tee-o, and
the origin is obscurecl by foreign souncls. Try υίοίηίίῃ,
vital, citsction, equation, civil, ancl equity, from vicinitas,
vitalis, citatio, aequatio, civilis, and aequitas. The
English mode reveals the truth, for ‘⁸' sounds furnish the
material for etymology.'' Apply the so-called Roman
and say mee-kee-nee—tahs‚ mee-tah-Zeess‚ keo-ta—tee-o‚ aye-
]cah-tee-o, ἦρε-1116646638, and aye-kee-tahs, and English
etymology is offered 3 sacrifice to 3 revolutionary inno·
vation. Again, look at the common vei-bal stems ιφὀισ,
val, dic, (luc, pel, ancl so on through¹ the list. When-
ever these stems occur in our language, the English
