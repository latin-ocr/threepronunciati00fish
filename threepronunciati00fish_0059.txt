THE TIIREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN. 45

bility for the prevalence at that time among the edu-
cated of a sound which conjecture can represent no
better than by -that which the German scholars have
adopted; the sound, namely, of their own oc (nearly
the F rench eu in fleur) .

“ Thus the oe in proelium would sound nearly like 0

An examinatior] of these extracts from the argu-
ments of those who favor the innovation will show that
the position of the writer, as to the basis on which the
so-called Roman system is founded, is fact. The rea-
son for ,pronouncing 9 always as 9 in 965 may be
regarded by some as valid and decisive. This letter is
ably treated by Roby, Corrsen, and others. That c
was always like k is not without difficulty and differ-
ence of opinion. This may be inferred from the quo-
tations already cited. That there is a real difference
of opinion among those who favor reform in England
is perfeetly clear from a statement made by Prof. Max
Muller. (Academy, Dec. 15, 1871.) Η6 says: “As Ι
looked upon a reform in the English pronunciation of
vowels as far more important than any improvement in
the pronunciation of certain consonants, my chief object
was to show that some compromise might be possible
in regard to c, and that, in allowing their weaker breth-
ren some liberty in the pronunciation of this one letter
besore i and e, thorough-going reformers need not have
felt ashamed, as if sacrificing ,an important principle.''
The weaker brethren referred to are those who do not.
feel inclined to pronounce e like k, before e, i, 3!- σε, oe,
and eu. Some of their reasons are given 111 the con-
spectus on the letter c already quoted.
