106 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS oF LATIN.

old pronunciation of their language in its best days has
a great interest doubtless sor scholam, but its use in
the practica] teachings of the language to boys is by
no means evident3 and though for a time it found some
favor, I think it is on the decline in England. It seems
spopen to these obJections : —-

Firsta That our knowledge is far too meagre to enable
us really to recover the old pronunciation of Latin as

Second, That there seems to be but little hope of
inducing other nations to adopt any such scheme as
that proposed by the two professors.
