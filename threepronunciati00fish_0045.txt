THE Tuam: PRONUNCIATIONS oF LATm. 31

Basle, in the year 1528, his famous dialoguc entitled
‘⁶ De recta Latini, Graecique sermonis pronuntiatione.'’
The text* on which that masterly review was based,
from beginning to end, was, ‘⁶ Nunc tota fere pronuntia-
tio depravata est tam apud Graeoos, quam apud Lati-
nos.'' Of this text, John Stuart Blackie, Professor os
Greek in the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, one of
the most distinguished scholars now living, says: “This
is proved in a very exhaustive style in an argument
extending to above two hundred pages. The powers of
the different letters are critically discussed, and the
relation of aecent and quantity illustrated both by
learned rules and by living examples. With regard to
the vowel sounds, which is the first point handled, he
had an easy task to prove that the slender sound, the
characteristic of the Byzantine Greeks, could not have
been the original sound of so many distinct vowels and
diphthongs. Sigus of different vowels are certainly not
made originally to confound, but to distinguish. The
confusion in this case is always of a later birth. What
Erasmus, however, sailed in here, and what, from want
of materials, he could not but fail in, was to show at
what period this confusion commenced, . . . and
the result, was that, by this assault of Erasmus, the
saith of scholars in the orthoepic traditions of gthe

- Byzantine elders was shaken in all the most learned

countries of Europe, and every nation set up vocalizing
Greek according to what seemed good in its own eyes.
Hence the motley babblement of Greek which now
prevails.'' *
