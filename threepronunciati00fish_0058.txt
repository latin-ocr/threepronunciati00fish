44 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS or LATm.

the Latin before the classical age. And the proposal,
therefore, of some modern scholars to return to that
antiquated sound for oe, is not in conflict with the
broadly marked general tendency of the Latin towards
a reduction of its diphthongal sounds, but singularly
at variance with the particular history of the diphthong
oe. The zeal of reform has impelled some to deny the
existence of any irregularity or obscurity in the Latin
pronunciation3 but these cannot help us here, nor can
we adopt any such adventurous dogma as prescribes
for our practice a sound which was obsolete for Cicero.

‘⁶ There is certainly a consolation for our ignorance in
the belief that the Romans themselves did not know for
any length of time together a certain sound for this diph-
thong. And if now it be thought necessary for us to fix
some uniforrn sound, by which in our practice to render ’
those words which, in printed texts furnished us, appear
written with the sign oe, we must choose between the
, sounds of ἒ, as insecus, Freneh, prem-e, or that of Ger-
man oc (ὅ), in Goeti'te. The first of these sounds is
recommended : —

“ 1. By considerations of convenience, chiefly in view
of the fact that in almost every instance (except,
namely‚ in the word, coetus, and possibly, a few others)
the words which are spelled in our texts sometimes with
oe are frequently (some as frequently) found with ae, as,
obscoenus. obscaenus, and even obscenus (Freneh, ob-
scene) 3 poenitet, paenitet3 moeror, maeror, etc„ etc.

‘⁸ 2. VVhere better reasons fail, the authority of the
post-classic Latin deserves to be heard 3 and this speaks
for ἒ. On the other hand, the general turn taken by
oe into u, in the practice of the cultivated Romans of
the classica] period, establishes a good degree of proba-
