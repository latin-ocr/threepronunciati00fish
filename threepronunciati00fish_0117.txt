THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN. 103

using the Italian vowels, and the hard c and 9. The
w sound for υ, though I am convinced it is right, leads
to such ludicrous results to an English ear, that 1 reJ‘ect
it in practice. Nor can Ι exact any but the old pro-
nunciation in ‘⁶ repetition '' Iessons. The J unior forms
do not even attempt the innovation. The indolence
of our boys has won the day, as it has at other
schools. In some, no doubt, the change has been more
or less successfully made, but we found the waste of time
involved in correcting mispronunciation to be fatal. It
is hard enough to teach the v-arious subJects required,
within the hours that are available, and if the Latin
hours are to 100 spent in mere vocal exercise, the lan-
guage can never be learnt in the time, nor the author
studied.

The change has little value for mere boys3 it is when
they come to comparative philology‚ and to tracing the
development of the same root in kindred tongues, that
the new pronunciation 15 50011 to bear fruit. But of
this boys cannot easily be convinced ; and accordingly
they did not care for a change that seemed to them
merely troublesome. If the pronunciation could 100
taught in childhood, the difficulty may disappear3 but
of this as yet no great prospect 15 visible, in England,
at least.

At the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the
new method seems to have taken root.

Believe me, my dear sir,

Very faithfully yours,
