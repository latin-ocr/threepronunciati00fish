40 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN.

4. The argument against the pronunciation of c like
k, that apparently has the most force, is the confusion
in words that end in -czfo and -tz'o ; but this, too, really,
is groundless, at least for high Latin, because the
confusion was not one of sound, but of the different
suffixes -cz'o, -tz'o ,· and this confusion was of a late date.
The earliest example we have of -tio for -cz’o was in
A. D. 192-211 (Corssen, Ι. 50-67), and there arc
only seven instances of -ci for -tzt in inscriptions before
the seventh century of our era. (Roby’s Lat. Gram.,
p. 52.)

Mommsen, in his notes on Livy, p. 175, says:
‘⁶ Nunquam in libro Veronensi commutatas reperies
litteras c et t, quod qui ante septimum saeculum ob-
tinuisse sibi persuadent, ne ii vehementer errant.’' Of
these seven inscriptiOnS, three are given by collectors -
who lived when the false spelling had become usual3
one is from a notoriously bad speller3 another is from
an inscription containing many misspelt words, and
the remaining two arc from an African inscription of
about A. D. 230. And even if these last two be rightly
copied, it is absurd to lay down a rule for the spelling
or pronunciation of a word in Cicero’s time, from the
spelling of the same word in a time when Latin had
fallen, and could hardly even be called classicall But
even supposing this confusion existed, does it really
prove anything? We have examples in many languages
where c and k are habitually confounded 3 one will suf·

for melier and ῡηοὶίὶἑ.

The following condensed argument for 9 hard is also
from Dr. Klapp. ‘⁶ G always hard, as 9 in ‘ 927226.³ '’
