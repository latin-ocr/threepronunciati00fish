118 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATtN.

the masterly understanding of our etymology a duty
incumbent on every one who regards the rights of his a
“mot-her tongue.'⁷

“But,'' replies Prof. W. Gr. Richardson, “the eye
has quite as much to do as the ear, perhaps more.'' He
virtually admits that the phonetic methodos pronoun-
cing Latin is a barren fig-tree in etymology, when the
sound is considered, but the eye, he thinks, may relieve
the case and make his new moder tolerable. From what
source do young people learn most of language in pro-
nunciation‚ if not also in meaning? We might answer,
By the ear. But in the present case we answer, that in
the use of the English pronunciation in its relation to
our etymology, the ear is wholly on our side and the
eye is as much on our side as on his3 nay, more, for
the hard pronunciation of the Latin makes a chasm
between what the ear hears and what the eye sees on
the printed page.

Prof. Tetlow, coming to the aid of his able friend,
sayS, ‘⁶ This appeal to the eye, moreover, is quite suffi-
cient to render obvious the derivation.'' ¹( ‘New Eng-
, land J ournal,'' N ov. 29.) He is writing of the deriva-
tion of English words. Very well. The eye 233 suffi-
cient to the task, and if all American and English b'oys
were comparative philologists, there might be force in
the argument of Mr. Tetlow. The question is not,
what ,53 sufficient to show the derivation of English
words? but, what system of Latin pronunciationis of
most value in English etymology, what system shows
the derivation most naturally, easily, and universally‘?
Asking such a question is at once an emphatic answer
in behalf os the system that “ reigns unquestioned '’ at
Oxford and Cambridge, England.
