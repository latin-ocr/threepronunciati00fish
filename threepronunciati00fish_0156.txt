142 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS or LA‘rm'.

conserve the English language and to mature English
scholarship, and adopting another that works such con·
fusion in all departments of learning and whose hard
sounds might in time revolutionize the Anglo-Saxon
tongue.

It must be obviOUS, therefore, to any considerate mind
that the change proposed by the reformers is radical
and revolutionary, and none but the most overwhelming
reasons can Justify⁷ any one in acquiescing in its claims‚

7. But it may be urged that the use of the REFORMED
METHoD would render English-speaking Latinists INTEL-
LIGIBLE ALL OVER THE WORLD. This argument would ”
come with great force, if founded on fact. Just here we
j0in issue with the friends of the new pronunciation. What
are the facts? These: no two nations in Europe pro-
nounce Latin alike; the Roman method does not coin-
cide with a single system in Europe 3 and the American
or Englishman, with the hard sounds, would be as
unintelligible on the Rhine, Seine, and Tiber, as if he
used the English mode. More: in Italy the true pro-
nunciation, as it is called, would add harshness to unin-
Α telligibility. For proof of what has Just been attested,
let the scholar examine the sounds of the modern
languages, and particularly the consonants which make
articulate speech what it is.

For instance, there is a wide difference in v, j, c, ,

between the Italian and the reformed system, as taught
in England and Germany : —

v=v, in Italian.

νεα), in German.

j=a vowel, in Italian.

j=y, in German.
