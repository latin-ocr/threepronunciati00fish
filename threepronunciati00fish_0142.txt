128 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS oF LATIN.

English mode puts the student in possession of those
that he does meet frequently and also of all those which
are even of rare occurrence. His accurate habits,
learned in the English mode, sweep in every proper
name, whether in the lexicon or out of it. But, say
the reformers, the pupil can learn how these names are
pronounced “from the dictionary or by imitation.'’
Are students apt or inclined to consult dictionaries?
Let experience the world over answer. As to imitation,
a teacher who knows no pronunciation but the new'
, one., will find it necessary to learn by imitation from
somebody else before he will be a safe guide in the
class-room. This writer tells us that is a student
“relies on his rules exclusively, he will call the city of
Alexander, Aleoecmczrmss' And so he will, sor as a clas-
sical word, it has no other pronunciation. To show
the vast superiority of the English over any other mode,
and especially the reformed method, take two students:
one has learned the English well, and the other the
“ Roman.'' Ask them to see how AEsculapius is pro-
nounced in the dictionary. The English student turns
to the page, and needs but one thing to put him in pos-
session of the desired information‚ and that is the length
of the penult. This found, he replies‚ the word is pro-
nounced ES-cz‘c-Zci'ffie-z‘os, for his English training has
taught him the sounds of the vowels and consonants in
their various relations. Then the ‘⁶ Roman '' turns to
the page, and reports the same word as being Ic'e-lcoo-
lascs-peevoos. He sees the ά marked long, but his ‘⁶ Ro-
man '² ᾶ is ah and not α in scete. His new mode makes
him mispronounce the diphthong oe, and, in a word, has
disqualified him to pronounce fourteen thousand or more
wor(IS‚ even with the highest authority in his hands·
