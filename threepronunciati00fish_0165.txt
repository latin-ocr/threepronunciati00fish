“PROF. Flsimn:

‘⁶ M'gl Dear Sir, -Ι have read your pamphlet (first
edition) on Latin Pronunciation, which you were kind
enough to hand me a few days since, and feel constrained
to make a formal and explicit acknowledgmcnt of my
obligations to you for it,

“ The so-called Roman method has been invented or
discovered, and I have not exactly known which, since
my academie undergraduate days, Wherein it was my
fortune to be pretty thoroughly drilled in the English
methodos Andrews and Stoddard's grammar and course.
My attention has been drawn to it at different times,
but mine has been the humble position of awaiting re· „
sults with a mind willing to accept whatever was sus-
tained by the best evidence adduced by specialists. A
distinguished gentleman of my acquaintance was once
asked by the advocates of the Harmonial Philosophy of
· the Andrew J ackson Davis school, to aid them in set-
ling their system, as 119 had had occasion to point out
some very serious obJections to it. He answered them,
that he had not time for that, but that if they would fix
it up and bring it to him, he would tell them what he
thought of it. It seems to me that you have given such
a fair, concise, and complete exhibit of the case by way
of statement, explanation, refutation, and argument,
that even a layman may venture to arise from the perusal
of your pamphlet with a pretty decided because intelli-
gent opinion that the pretensions of the novel method
⁶ rest on an unsettled and inadequate foundation‚'
(page 11), and still further and positively, as you ex-
press it on page 23, ⁶ that for English-speaking people
the English pronunciation is the best.’
