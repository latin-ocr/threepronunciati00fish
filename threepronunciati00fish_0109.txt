THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN. 95

“ I am more convinced than ever, if possible, that
the attempt to introduce the'so-callcd Roman method
of Latin pronunciation will prove a failure.''

Prof. Thacher made a thorough investigation of the

The oldest academy of its kind in America is Phil-
lips Academy‘g at Andover, Mass. This venerable and
Justly celebrated school held its centennial celebration
in June, 1878, when fifteen hundred of its sons returned
to its sacred halls to renew the hallowed associations of
· 0110 hundred years. Such an assembly of distinguished
men have rarely come together in the history of any
school in the world. That academy has prepared more
young men for college than any other in our country,
and for an entire century has taught the English pro-
nunciation of Latin. The same system is used there
to-day. What academy in New England‚ or out of it,
can point to such a roll of illustrious names? C. F. P.
Bancroft, Ph. D.‚ the present principal, a most able
scholar and teacher, still elings to a pronunciation that
has yieldedsuch magnificent results in profound scholar-
ship for generations past. His letter is of interest to
teachers.
