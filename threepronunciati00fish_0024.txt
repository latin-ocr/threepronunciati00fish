10 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN.

you would have thought, adds he, ‘that all Bcebel had
come toqetlzeo·.”’ All those speaking were using the
Continental method. The variety among the nations ·
on the Continent is most graphieally sketehed in the
quotation from Esehenburg, himself among the ablest
of European seholars. In the pronunciation of the
vowels there may be an approximate agreement, but in
the oonsonants there is the greatest diversity. English-
speaking people furnish the only anomalous, and we
must sa)7 the only humiliating, example of a great*
nation literally ignoring its own and seeking across the
Atlantio foreign sounds with which to pronounoe this
grand old language. There might be reason in the
thing if the Continental nations had the true pronuncia- ’
tion, or, putting this supposition asicle, if they had even
an approximate uniformity among themselves. As
matters now stand, the soholar who seeks the Conti-
nental mode, without defining aeeurately what variety
of it he wishes, is much like the rustic in his pursuit os
the will-o’-the-wisp.

How the native tongues on the Continent pronounoe
Latin, after their own analogies, may be seen from a
glanee at the Romanee languages of Southern Europe,
the Freneh, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish, to which
the Latin stands in the relation of a common progen-
itor. The letters e, 9, j, and υ will be sufficient : —

FRENCII. rrAuAN.
ozs, before e, i, and y. ezch in cherry, before e, i,
gzs in pleasure, before e, i, ansi y.
and y. gzg in gem.
jzz in azure. ιῙ---66 in see (a vowel).
