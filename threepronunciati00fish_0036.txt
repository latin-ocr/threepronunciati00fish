22 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS or LATIN.

οι· our own, that every one of them runs like a thread
through every page, and constitutes an important ele-
ment of it. The difficulties which attend this subJect
are inherent in it, are such that there is no nation in
Europe, the Classical scholars of which agree in claim-
ing that they can reproduce the pronunciation of the
Roman forum, or in attempting to do SO.'' Haldeman,
on page 18 of his ‘⁶ Affixes to English XVordsss' says,
“The Latin alphabet is composed of the following
twenty letters,'’ naming them, and holding that only
nine, B, D, F, H, N, P, Q, T, X, had the same power
asin English. But suppose there is (me sound, like the
diphthong ce or oe, running “like a thread through
every page,'' and in a multitude of words, which is not
known and about which there is a variety of opinions,
will any man affirm that we know the pronunciation
of a language when this multitude of words contains
an unknown or at least a perplexing and unsettled
sound, and yet eleven unknown sounds are conceded?
Let us now notice closely some of the difficulties sur-
rounding the inquiries under discussion : —-

1. Tmm. Roby tells us that it is a “ pronuncia-
tion that has not been uttered by an accredited repre-
sentative '' for seventeen hundred years. The task
before the reformers, therefore, is to thread their way
back through the phonetic labyrinth of fifty generations,
and trace with accuracy the pedigree of the Latin sounds.
Let it be borne clearly in mind that in the so-called
Roman mode the phonetic element is absolutely vital ,·
the sounds of the vowels differ in qucmtity, but never in
quality. Haldeman holds that ‘⁶ a long vowel (or
syllable) is twice the length of a short one, and has the
same quality.’' (Affixes, p. 19.)
