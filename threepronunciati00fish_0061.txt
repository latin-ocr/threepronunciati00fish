THE Tuum: rnonuncmmons OF LATm. 47

pronunciation of these letters in such positions must
have been the same, cr nearly the same, and therefore
thatc could not have beon pronounced as lc. Thus, sola-
tium, convitium, suspitio, tribunitius, nuntius, conditio,
among others, are often spelled solacium, convicium,
suspicio, tribunicius, nuncius, condicio. A still stronger
evidence of this is to be found in the ancient names of
persons. There would seem to be no safer method of
'determining the ancient pronunciation of letters than
by a recurrence to the proper names in which they are
to be sound. Names alter little, if at all, for centuries.
They are in constant use, and handed down in hundreds
and thousands of families from one to another genera-
tion. The sound is constantly on the tongue and on
the ear, and is subject naturally to less variation than
in any other words. The first mispronunciation of it
would be saluted with laughter. Even were the spell-
ing lost, the pronunciation would remain. Now, among
the ancient names c is constantly used interchangeably
with t, showing that these two letters were in such
cases nearly, if not exactly, equivalents in sound.
Thus, among others, Marcia is sometimes spelled
Martia3 Mucius, MutiusÍ¾ Neratius, Neracius3 Portia,
Porcia. The c must, therefore, have had the soft
Italian sound. Again, such names as Celsus, Caesar,
Decius, Cincinnatus, Caecilia, Marcellus, Lucius, Lucia,
Lucilla, Marcia, and many others of the same character,
have always been in use in Italy. Is it possible to
believe that the present pronunciation of these names
in Italy, which have been in constant, familiar use in
hundreds of families for twenty centuries at least, is
entirely false? WVhen did it suffer this change? Why
was it altered? The syllabus would have us pronounce
