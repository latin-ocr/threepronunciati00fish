28 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN.

the ear hundreds of times with the keenest accuracy,
and yet our lips refuse to produce what we hear. The
fact about which we now speak is so notorious that in
France it is almost impossible to find any foreigner who
speaks the French sans decent until, it may be, after
the living teacher has drilled him and French politeness
has trained him for years.

Prof. Haldeman and Prof. W. G. Richardson tell us
that our facilities for learning the true pronunciation
of the ancient Latin are equal to those we have for
learning the French in the use of books without a liv-
ing teacher. Grant it. But before any argument is

this without the French people around him, and without
a master? Americans may form theories in their
studies, as to French sounds, from books ; but the expe-
rience of one week in Paris will reduce them to the
sober conviction that they must go to work or cease
forever all their ridiculous attempts to speak the living
French. The trouble is, they have never known the
real sounds of the language, and with books alone they
never will know them, We candidly confess, therefore,
that the position taken by the distinguished scholars
named above, in regard to one of the Romance tongues,
goes very far toward convincing us that finding the ’

an impossibility. The Latin is to us, not only a for-
eign, but a dead language, — a fact that deserves to be
