PREFAOE. η

Fon more than a score of years, my time has been spent in
-the class-room in the Department of Latin. Thousands os
young mem-within the period named, have received their
training, to some extent, at least, at my hands. Many of
these, in their labors as teachers, have under their care the
ancient languages. Inquiries as to methods of teaching and
pronunciation have become so frequent as to call for the pub-
lication os an article Which might be sent to those interested‚
and a correspondence be thus avoided, which might otherwise
prove burdensome. This state of facts will, in large part,
explain the origin and elementary character of this discussion.

It is natural, too, that persons engaged in teaching, adopt-
ing to some extent the modes of former instructors, should
wish to know somewhat more fully the reasons which in-
fluenced those instructors in the course they were pleased to
pursue.*

The first edition os Tmn Tmmn PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN
hasbeen exhausted for some months past. The present en-
larged edition has been brought out to a very considerable
extent, from the influence of teachers and scholars in various
parts of our country, whose letters on the subJect manifest
deep interest in the pronunciation of the Latin tongue. The
hope is indulged, therefore, that the work in the form now
offered, may not only· tend to answer inquiries alluded to
above, but also that it may not be unacceptable to teachers
in general, who are engaged in giving instructions in this
department of study.
