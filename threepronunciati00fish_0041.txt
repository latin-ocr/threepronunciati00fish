THE Tuaen PRONUNCIATIONS or LATIN. - 27

orthography from 64 to 117 A. D., and, of course, the
best exhibition of the phonetics of the Romans. But
this very orthography has caused no little trouble, and
the matter is not yet settled, and consequently, the
phonetics depending on the spelling cannot possibly
be determined. What becomes of Cicero, when such
changes were made in orthography in a hundred years?
Even if we had the spelling and phonetics of the post-
Augustan age definitely fixed, there may be a serious
barrier still between us and the phonetics of the Golden
Age. Brambach says ε “ At the beginning of this
period (100 B. C.)‚ the Latin language, as is frequently
evidenced by the texts of these authors, was in process
of a rapid development in respect to forms.” With a
view to distinguish the usage of these writers in the
matter of pronunciation and orthography, we may
divide them into three groupS.

Taking the whole case as it lies before US, especially
in view of the rapid changes in spelling and necessarily
in the phonetics of wordS, as indicated above, we can
see at a glance that it is no easy matter to decide how
Cicero, Caesar, and Horace pronounced Latin.

3. Notice, too, the difficulty of learning a FOREIGN
LANGUAGE under the most favorable circumstances, so
as to speak it accurately. Especially mastering the pho-
netics of any tongue not our own is beset with difficul-
ties peculiarly hard to overcome, and which seIdom, if
ever, are overcome by those who have reached adult
years, even when they hear the language spoken every
day for almost a lifetime. Take the 'French as an ’
illustration. Look at the alphabet. It is the Roman
alphabet and ours, too. The sign is perfectly familiar.
The sounds of some of these signs may be uttered in
