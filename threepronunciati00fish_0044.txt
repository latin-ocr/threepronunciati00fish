30 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS or LATm.

advocated by some very eminent men, it has been
adopted by very few scholars.

When c and 9 are compared with the corresponding
letters in Greek, we are comparing things to us un-
known, and surely all inferenees will be unreliable. Ο
and 9 are two letters about which there is as little dis-
pute perhaps as any two that could be cited from the
two cognate tongues. ‘No twonations have ever had
the same system of phonetics. When the Roman Lat-
inist, in his transliteration, puts Latin into Greek letters,
or vice versa, there may be a visual correspondenee, and
at the same moment he may make a failure in the pho-
netic clement which is the main point of inquiry.

Modern Greek differs from the ancient in matter as
wellas in forms, ancl the pronunciation may differ as
widely as the matter and the forms of the modern
tongue. We have it on the highest authority that
Sophocles, for many years Professor of Greek in Har-
vard University, holds that the modern Greek was of
comparatively little service in mastering the ancient, as
we have it in Thucydides, Xenophon, and Demosthenes.
It adds greatly to the weight of his testimony when
we recall the fact that Sophocles himself is a modern
Greek, with a soul that thrills with emotion at the
associations that hang around the land of his fathers.
We fix attention on the fact that the phonetie system of
the old Greeks is not known, that the modern does not
relieve us of any difficulty, and that Latin orthoephy
cannot be settled by reference to a system that has been,
at least in large part, confessedly lost for ages.

There is another fact that may tend to strengthen
‘⁶ right reason '' on this point. Erasmus, a scholar of
splendid genius and most refined taste, published at
