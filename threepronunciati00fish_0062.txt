·48 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATm.

Cicero, Kikero. But the name of Cicero has always
been a living name, familiar to every ear in Italy, and
110 0110 111010 ever heard it pronounced Kikero. It is
alleged, as an argument in favor of this pronunciation,
that it was spelled with the kappa, Κικερων, when
written in Greek. But supposing it were pronounced·
by the ancient Romans, as by the moderns, Chichero,
how were the Greekswith their alphabet to represent
this sound? They had no letter with which to spell it
nearer than kappa. The chi was a deep guttural, the
kappa was the soft 703 they had no other letter, and
they took the one nearest to it. And, still more, do
we know what was the exact sound of the Greek
kappa? The same reasons also apply to the Greek
spelling of all similar names, such as Caesar and Celsus.
In fact, when we find Caius spelled Γαιος, 0110 15
tempted to ask why the Γ 15 11010 used instead of the
kappa, if the kappa had the sound we suppose of our
own lc.

‘⁶ In like manner, in all ancient names of persons
and places in which 9 occurs before e and i, it is pro-
nounced soft by the Italians, and this affords one of
the strongest prooss that it was so pronounced by the
Latins. As examples os this, among many others,
may be cited Virginia, Virginio‚ Girgente, Egisto‚
Virgilio, Eugenio, Gemma, and Gelasio. Not only the
Italians give this soft sound, which still adheres to
these words even in English, but there is not one of
the Romance nations by whom it is pronounced hard.
The Spaniards aspirate it, and between French and
Italians there is but a shade of difference, it being
soster in French, and having a slight sound of the z.
No one pronounces it hard, like 9 in English yet.
