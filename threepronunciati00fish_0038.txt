24 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN.

are everywhere, their language lives, their Sacred
Oracles are found among every civilized people; the
cognate Arabic is spoken by perhaps a hundred millions
at this honr, the vowel signs are in every Hebrew
grammar, the whole Israelitish race stands with eyes
fixed on Jerusalem3 and after all, their ancient pronun-
είαίίοη has been lost. This is a truth recognized by
Jewish scholars everywhere. And this is true, while
the opportunities afforded to preserve the true sounds
have been, beyond all comparison, better than in either

us, is complete: the phonetic clement is forever lost.
So the Latin words are before us in all their reality,
but what Daniel will unfold the phonetic elements that
have slept in silence for ages beneath those signs?

CONsISTENT PHONETIG 3Υ3ΤΕΜ, EVEN THEORETIOALLY.
No proof of this 13 needed other than an ordinary
acquaintance with the Spelling Reform Association
in America. It may be answered that the purpose
of this association is to reform orclzoqraphy, not
orchoepy. But in all their schemes of reform, the
esscntial clement in the ideal alphabet is that each
elementary sound should have its own unvarying
sign, and each sign its own unvarying sound. In all
