THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN. 93

It is but just to say that the report made by the Bureau
of Education is only approximately true. The com-
piler seems to have anticipatcd this when 116 says:
-“ Α3 1111 Latinists are not necessarily orthoepistS, and
as thc 1611113 113611 are not always well defined, Ι sear Ι
have made some errors in classification.''
Prof. Johnson, of 1116 University of the City of New
York, under date os Jan. 22, 1879, says: “ You will
rightly infer from the above, that Ι do not regard the
university as fairly belonging to the class of colleges in
which the Roman method is adopted.'' In the same
letter Prof. Johnson states that he gives Prof. Lane's
rulcs for the pronunciation of Latin to 1116 Senior Class
while reading Lucretius, and that ‘⁶ 1116 whole matter
is one of curiosity rather.'' Some institutions, since
the report was made, have either returned 10 1116
English method, or adopted it for the first time. The
Missouri University has adopted the English within the
past two years. The prediction 13 made that other
changes will take place in some of the 36110013 which
now employ the new method‚ which has made many
conquests in 1116 11131 1611 years, chiefly because of the
following reasons: 1. Its name, the Latin or Roman
immod,- 2. Its high pretensions as producing Latin
sounds as they came from the lips of Cicero; 3. The
aggressiveness of its advocateS, coupled often with
their celebrity as scholars 3 4. The impression sought to
be made by its friends, that its use was a kind of syn-
onyme for progress and ‘⁶ advanced scholarship’';
5. The continuous repetition of the assertion that the
new pronunciation has been adopted in the universities
and great schools of England aud Germany, — an asser-
tion utterly without foundation, as will be seen by a
