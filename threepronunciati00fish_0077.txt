THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS oF LATIN. 63

not the same soundas α in sate, z· in machine, o in kole,
and u in rude. These words, as the least practised ear
can detect, differ not only in quantity, but radically in
quality. A glauce too reveals the obvious truth that
Haldeman—-and J. F. Richardson agrees with him —
does not agree with Tafel and Corssen, in representing
the short sounds of ο, i, and e. Who does not see that
ei in eiqht, z· in deecit, and O in obcy‚ are not the same
as e in then, z· in sit, and ο in nor? Is scholars on the
side of the new pronunciation believe in the phonetic
method and understand it alike, then failure to represent
it harmonicusly‚ even in their ideal schemes, is simply
unpardonable. Roby tells us that o long=o in home,
and ο short=o in dot. Blair, that o long=o in potent,
and ο short=o in potation. Roby tells us that e long=e
in met, lengthened, and that e short=e in met. Blair,
that long e=a in yate, and short εἶα in αένίαῑ.

We would fix emphatic attention on two things that
are sels-evident: 1. That these distinguished scholars
do not agree with each other3 2. That their exhibition
of their favorite pronunciation, as shown in many
writers, is not consistent with their oft-repeated theory.
Any one who has any doubts as to the correctness of
the statements here made is earnestly requested and
urged to examine the subject for himself.

Before leaving this general want of harmony in re-
gard to vowel sounds, long and short, it is worth while
to notice how the followers of the so—called Roman
method exhibita to us the long sounds of the voweIS.

Blair affirms that clong=a in qate.

Roby, that e long=e in met, lengthened.

W. G. Richardson, in the Report published by the
Bureau of Education‚ says that e long= the French e, ¹
