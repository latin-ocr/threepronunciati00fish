THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN. 9

the sounds of the vowels and diphthongs as heard in
the Italian.

One of the chief arguments for the adoption of what

scholars strangely enough call the Contincntal system,
has been that it would enable learned men, by means
of a common pronunciation, to make themselves 1111301-
ligible all over Europe. This idea of grammarians
and others is founded on an utter misapprehension of
the facts. There is not now, and there has never been,
, any international identity in the pronunciation of the
Latin, and this is especially true os Continental Europe.
There is a general agreement in the vowel sounds, but
in the consonants, which make articulate speech what
it is, there is very great diversity of sound. Each
nation has its own phase, of what American scholars
term the Continental mode. There is the French phase,
the Spanish phase, the Italian phase, the Hungarian
phase, the Swedish phase, and the German phase 3 and,
strange as it may seem, there are sharply defined vari-
eties of the Continental method in use in the different
German States. What has just been said is a sample
of an actual state of facts as existing on the Continent
at this hour. Eschenburg, 011 page 550 of his ‘⁶ Clas-
sical Literature,’' says : -
’ “ It is worthy of remark that the Frenchman, Ger-
man, and Italian, in pronouncing Latin, each yields to
the analogies of his own tongue. Each of them may
condemn the others, while each commits the same error,
or, rather, follows in truth the same general recle.
