THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN. 69

Were these diphthongs transmitted from the aneient
Latin as unintelligible as the whorls Sehliemann finds,
as viewed in their relation to ancient Aryan eustoms,
still historie piety must dietate their literal preservation.

The enigmas of the past are not to be trampled under
our feet, nor rudely pushed aside, as we know not what
revelations may ultimately be made to us through the
very perplexities to which they give rise.

The differenee in regard to oe, indicated above, will
appear in pronouneing the word coelum.

Coelum=ku3stloom (u=vowel sound in whirl). Blair.

Coeluin=kaq-Zoom (σι--α in fate). Gildersleeve.

Coelun1=k03J-Z00m (oy=0i in coil). Tafel, ete.

Coelun1=kowy-Zoom (owy=0wy in showgs). Halde-
man.

Again, notice the differenoe of opinion and usage in
regard to the letter v. The question among the new
“ Romans '’ is whether v shall be pronouneed like w or
like the labio-dental υ. Unquestionably the differenoe
is a wide one, and rests mainly on diverse phonetie
theories. The two parties among the Romanists‚ rest-
ing on diverse theories‚ have from the beginning held
their ground so tenaeiously as to render agreement
simply impossible. Differenee in theory, and also in
usage, is confessed by all scholars throughout the
world. Hence it seems wholly unneeessary to diseuss
this point at any length. Those wishing to examine
the matter may refer to Roby's Grammar, Peile’s
Greek and Latin Etymology‚ and Prof. Twining's
article in ‘⁶ The Wester11,'’ already mentioned. A very
brief examination will verify the remark of A. J. Ellis,
in his work on “ Early English Pronuneiation” : “ The
sound of υ in ancient Latin is a matter of dispute.''
