136 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS oF LATIN.

the Latin. Can such words long retain their present
pronunciation against the united, though perhaps un-
conscious and involuntary inclination of all educated
men who speak English? For we think it must be the
tendency of those who become familiar with the pro-
posed pronunciation of Latin, to extend it to English
words which are nearly identical in form with Latin
words, and are identical with them in meaning; and
the more familiar such persons are with the former, the
more inclined will they be to the latter. The word
necessity, for instance, must follow the lead of necessi-
tas (nakassetahs); civil, civilis (keeveelees); Ζαοίᾱ,
lucidus (lookeedoos) ; invincible, invincibilis (eenveen-
keebcelees); con-scions, conscius (conskeeoos), and so
on through words innumerable.'' The Roman Latinist
answers this argument thus: “ The words that belong
to the general vocabulary of English speech are not
under the dominion of any class of persons 3 and their
pronunciation will remain stationary, or will fluctuate
quite independently of special movements among
scholars.'' But scholars are not the only ones to have
influence in this case. There are multitudes of stu—
dents of both sexes whose power will be as effectual as
that of the writer or teacher. Let the thousands of
students of Latin in America to-day be taught the new
method, and the danger to our own tongue from the
harsh and hard souncls of the so-called phonctic mode ,
would be amazingly increased. This is true not only
in the abstract but in the concrete. There are students
in this university at this hour whose English is marred
by having been taught the innovation. The same is
true in other places. “
