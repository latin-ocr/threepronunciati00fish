66 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LA'rxN.

appear, nothing less than the resurrection of a Roman
more perfectly representing the native language than
even Cicero or Varro, if the Latin was settled in its
phonetics‚ would be able to release us.

Again‚ Prof. Blair, on page 56 of his “Latin Pro-
nunciation‚” takes issue with Prof. J. F. Richardson‚
as to the sound of oe.

He says ε -

“ In the face of these statementS‚ and in spite of all
the evidence of a changed orthography, Prof. Richard-
son (⁶‘Roman Orthoepy‚'' N. Y„ 1859) lays down the
law, ‘ σε (ετ-αι’) sounds like ay, the English adverb of
affirmation) Will he render Virgil's AEaeoe after this
fashion? (vid. AEneid, ΙΙΙ. 386.) And with hisqu=7m
will he read, Infernike lacus Ayayayk' insula Kirkay ”2
The line referred to runs thus: “Infernique lacus
AEceaeqece insula Gircoe.'' Richardson wrote in 1859;
Blair‚ in 1873. The quotation given carries its own
comment as to how far they agreed on the diphthong
ce. We tender thanks to Prof. Blair for the state-
ment which he has put in our possession, The advo-
cates of reformed pronunciation‚ they themselves being
the witnesses‚ do not agree. But enough on the diph-
thong oe.

When reduced to practice in the class-room, observe
how these differences become painfully evident. For
illustration, take the nominative plural of hora, 7202·ae : —

Horae=hoe-rcty. Blair, Gildersleeve‚ and others.

Horae=hoe-rye. Harkness, Richardson‚ and others.

Horae—-hoe-mh‚ A=a in half=a in father. Roby.

Prof. W. G. Richardson, in criticising the ‘⁶ Three
Pronunoiations of Latin,'' makes this significant admis-
sion: “AE is rather bad, but by no means a Cannae.''
