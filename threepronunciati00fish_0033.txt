For these three positions reference may be made to
Prof. Blair's work, one of the 11051 yet published on this
subject in Amcrica.

A source of testimony much relied 011 by Roman
Latinists is the modern Romance languages of Southern
Europe‚— a point which shall receive proper attention
as we proceed.

But what kind of evidence is it upon which these
lofty 01511115 510 based? The answer 15, and must in
the nature of the case 100, “Probable evidence.''

It is not at all our design in this discussion to under-
value probable or moral evidence. Far from it.

The countless facts 01· history, 01· 1110 50100005, 5οᾶ
of Christianity itself rest on this klnd of proof.

The human mind is so constituted as to rest with as
much confidence in probable evidence 01· 1110 degree 01·
moral certainty as 111 demonstrative or mathematical
evidence. We do not obJ‘ect to the so-called Roman
method because its basis is moral evidence, as from the

because it is destitute 01· 11151 measure of evidence 01·
11115 kind which would 01111110 11 10 our 5000111500ος and
our critics who drew a contrary meaning from our
words fell into very strange misapprehensions 01· state-

difficulties to 110 shown hereafter, no scholar 050 make
the least pretension that the resurrected system rests
011 any such basis as moral certainty. Far from it.
