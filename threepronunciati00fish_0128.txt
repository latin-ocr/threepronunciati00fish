² 114 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LA'rlN.

the Latin Zanquczye, though it has been used for three
hundred years in England. Let it be admitted that
the so-called Roman system, as advocated by Corssen
and Roby‚ sandy as its basis is, at least in vital parts
is theoretically correct. Let its claims, based largely
on probabilities‚ all be conceded; still, admitting the
correctness of a theory and reducing that theory to
practice are radically and vitally different. My posi-
tion is. therefore, most unhesitatingly taken that for

· English-speaking people the English pronunciation is

the best. Some of the reasons will be briefly stated :—

l. The last edition of VVebster's Dictionary claims
120‚000 words. Of these, according to the highest
authority, only about 23,000 are of Anglo-Saxon origin.
De Vere (page 43) says that the English is the only
European idiom that so combines the classic and Gothic
elements as to make the Gothic the basis and the Latin
the superstructure. ,

According to Prof. Wffitney, in his ‘⁶ Life and
Growth of Language,'’* nearly five sevenths of the
words contained in our large dictionaries are of clas-
sical derivation and only about two sevenths native
Germanic. Far the greater part are from the, Latin.
The same author says that our scientific and philo-
sophical vocabulary comes mainly from the Latin.

The number of words derived from the Greek is con-
siderable, especially in scientific use, but far less than
from the Latin. Take some of the richest Latin pre-
fixes found in our language. With co or con as a
prefix, we have 5‚600 words 3 in or im, 25900 3 re, 2‚200 ;
