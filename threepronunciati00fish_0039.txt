THE Tuam: PRONUNCIATIONS oF LA'rm. 25

purely phonetic spelling, there is a vital and indissolu-
ble connection between the sound and its sign, For
over a quarter of a century, some of eur ablest scholars
have given much time and great learning to the prep-
aration of such an alphabet. What is the result?
No such alphabet has been agreed on, and there are
three “schemes of 1·eform,’' each of which finds able
advocates: 1. Some* favor the use of “new signs ''
altogether; 2. Others, the Roman “letters with Ro-
man values''; 3. Others still insist on “reform ac-
cording to English analogies.” (See March's address
before the International Convention for the Amend-
ment of Orthography, Philadelphia, 1816.) Prof.
March says : ‘⁶ For my part, I do not regard it as a wild
vision to imagine such an alphabet in the future. But
it is obvious that any such system must win its way
very slowly, first into (zo-ordinate use with the Roman
alphabet, and after a struggle of many generations, to
its displacement3 so that the improvement of our
present alphabet is still to be desired while it lasts.”
This quotation from this distinguished scholar hints at
existing obstacles, and indicates his opinion as to the
best way of amending English orthography.

Look again at the various systems of stenographic
signs. Those of Mr. Pitman, Bishop Wilkins‚ and Mr.
Bell are best known Nobody claims that they are
alike. Obviously, they are remarkably unlike, and
yet all three are labored, prolonged, and learned
attempts to set forth by signs the sounds of our own
English. But take the system of Mr. Pitman, which
has undergone such radical changes in a quai-ter of a
century that those, Ι am told, who learned it then, are
at sea in the use of the same system as now taught, and

are reduced to the necessity of acquiring it in order to
