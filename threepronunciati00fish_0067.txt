THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN. 53

spoken at every turn, -it is difficult, to say the least,
to imagine that in all these the letter c has been vitally
changed in its pronunciation by the Italians and direct
descendants of the Romans. For instance, is it prob-
able that such unohanged words as the following are
all mispronounced now in Italy?-— civitas (civita),
cervello (cerebellum), celebre, cedo, celere, celare, cella,
cenere, ciccus, cibus (cibo), cimex (cimice), circa,
cippus (cippo), cinctura, cista, sacerdos.’'

οε is so fruitful a source of diversity of opinion and
argument among the reformers that no further notice
of that diphthong is at all necessary.

It may be noticed that Tafel gives ο before e, i, and.
θεῖε.
