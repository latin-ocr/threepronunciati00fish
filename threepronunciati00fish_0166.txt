152 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS oF LATIN.

⁶⁴ The general discussion of this vexed question, as
some have 01105011 10 0011 it, is plainly in the interest os
clean ancl accurate scholarship. It has been the viee

ualisms. The elassies are entitled to equal protection
against empirioists. Is it not true that the indetermin-
ate and tentative element is in the so-eallecl Roman, in
exeess of every other method? This is fatal to a prefer-
01100 for it.
