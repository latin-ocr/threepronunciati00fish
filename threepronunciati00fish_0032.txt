18 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN.

be, is made with the profoundest rcgard for the distin-
guished scholars who have written in favor of the
Roman method. But a system with such pretensions
must abide, as it professes to do, the results of the
crucible. Rob)v himself in his Preface says: “ An in·
- quiry into classica] Latin is [an inquiry] into a pro-
nunciation which has not been uttered by an accredited
representative for the last seventeen hundred years.''
(Page 30, edition of 1871.) Yet they have gone back
and brought down to our day a pronunciation which pur-
ports not to differ from that of Cicero ‘⁶ more than the
pronunciation of educated men in one part of England
would differ from that heard in other parts.’' (Roby.)

On what are these claims based?

1. The Latin grammar-iaus: beginning with Varro,
64 B. C„ and coming down to Priscianus Caesariensis,
who taught at Constantinople‚ 570 A. D. In reference
to these grammarians, Prof. Blair, in his introduction‚
says: “To whose instructions we must now turn, in
order to gather by inference‚ and not without great
care and panis, the information which might have been
easily and more certainly had by spending an hour with
the Roman boys in their elementary school.'’

2. The information gleaned from grammarians is '
compared with three sources of probable proof.

(a) The traditions of scholars and the modern Ro-
manic languages.

(b) The Greek mode of rendering Latin sounds into
their tongue. The Greeks attempted to imitate the
Latin sounds as perfeotly as their letters would allow.

(c) The third probable proof is “ the face ,of the lan-

guage itself, as seen in its records which have been pre-
served to us.’'
