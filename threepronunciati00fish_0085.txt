THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN. 71

universal is worse than Utopian3 ay, it is a physical
impossibility over a large part of Continental Europe.
If the enthusiastic reformers are right and have found
and resurrected the real Anciem Pronuncz‘atz'on, is it not
a pity that whole nations‚ some of them tlfe most
learned on earth, will never be able to use it? In
French‚ Spanish‚ Portuguese and Italian, v=v in Eng-
lish. These languages look back to a common ances-
tor, the stately and imperial Latin, but they can never
fully utilize the results of this “ new philology that
has been let loose ’' in the last twenty—five years.

This perilous condition of affairs is relieved by the
proposition of A. J. Ellis (Academy, No. 19), who
advises that English speakers of Latin should not pro-
nounce v like w, because it is needless to adopt α sozmd
which Continental nullon-3 cannot produce. Whatever
their theories may be, though demonstrated, whatever
their arguments may be, even if unanswerable, those
who hold that v=w‚ must ahandon their ground, sacri-
fice the results of laborious research, and adapt them-
selves to nature's order of things on the Continent.
Thus only can uniformity be attained with the Romanic
nations. Is it not a little strange that these nations
have lost the power of uttering one of the sounds used
by a common progenitor? Let it be remembered here,
that those who urge that νεα), tell us that they are
producing the sounds as they fell from the lips of Cicero,
Virgss, and Horace.

To return to our proposition. At present, there is no
harmony. If harmony is ever to be realized in the
future, one party in this controversy over υ must abandon
their ground, whether right or wrong. As the case now
stands, some phases of the discussion are not far
