THE 'rmum PRoNUNc1AT10Ns oF LATIN. 125

3. LATIN AND GREEK PROPER NAMus.——Of these
there are not less than sourteen thousand found in our
large dictionaries. These names are pronounced, not
after the Continental method, much less after the doubt-
fully resurrected meth0d3 but in all cases after the
Walkerian or English system. This is a consideration
of vast importance. A class taught the “hard'' or
Roman mode of pronunciation will, in multitudes of
instances, call these names wrong. This is daily obvi-
ous to any instructor who uses the Latin method, more
especially, if he thinks it worth while to conform to
standard authority. The English pronunciation brings
with it convenience, consiste ncy, and accuracy in proper
names. The student does not need to pronounce
Caesar, Ki—sar, when he reads the text and Se-zar when
he translates.

It should be borne in mind, too, that several thousand
classical words have been omitted in the most recent
editions of our great dictionaries. The omission em-
braces monosyllables, a large number of dissyllables,
words of rare occurrence, and many fictitious names
found in the poets. The number of classical names is
vastly larger than a mere passing acquaintance might
lead scholars to suppose. The best reply to this argu-
ment for the English mode is taken from a recent
writer on the side of the hard method :—

“In the first place, how many of these 14,000
proper names are Greek, and not Latin at all? The
more troublesome half, probably. Would Dr. Fisher
have us reverse his argument, and going back for the
sake of these Greek proper names twe11ty÷five years,
revive the old pronunciation of Greek, with its English
sounds of the vowels and its disregard of the written
