THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN. 13

then, prcvailing in Western Europe and our own country,
five are strictly national. Their differcnces find at once
an original and 311 explanation in the fact that the
schola-rs of each nation have followed, in their pronun-
ciations of Latin, the analogies of their own vernacu-
lar. In this way, while making sure of mutual disa-
greement, αἷί 113νο departed more or less from the true
Roman method, and t-he whole subject has been in-
volved in uncertainty and confusion. Meanwhile the
pseudo-Continental system, destitute alike 01“ historica-l
dignity and scientific accuracy, and lacking even the
poor support of national preJudice and pride, is power-
less to mediate and compose these differences. Although
it undoubtedly avoids some of the grossest absurdities
peculiar to the English system, it lacks the elements
which command respect, and can never establish a claim
to universal adoption and use.’'

An able writer in the “ Globe-Democrat” in April
last, in commenting on my pamphlet on the “Three
Pronunciations of Latin,'' says: “ Mr. Fisher cites, for
instance, the proper name Cicero, and shows that the
Italians, the French, the Spaniards, and the Germans
differ from one another as widely as from the English.
We could wish that the professor had added that 01“
Hungary, wherein, and not exclusively in ecclesiastical
affairs, Latin remained a living language after it had
disappoared from general use everywhere else in Chris-
tendom. In Maria Theresa’s time the deliberations of
the Diet were in Latin, and within the present gener-
ation it was spoken freely in the 11011105 of the wealth-
ier and better educated classes. The pronunciation
differed in toto from all those cited in the pamphlet, and
it is certainly as likely to have been as nearly like that
