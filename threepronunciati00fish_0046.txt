flowing from the influence of Erasmus, he does not

(1455-1522) was used wherever Greek was studied.
The correctness of the modern Greek pronunciation was
called in question by Erasmus in his dialogue between⁴
a lion anda bear, as already stated, in the year 1528.
What is the condition of things now in America? Two
years ago, a large number of letters was collected by
Gen. Eaton, Commissioner of Education, and placed
in the hands of Dr. J ames R. Boise, Professor of Greek,
Chicago. Dr. Boise examined one hundred and twenty-
