26 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN.

use it. Let any one follow the records of the Spelling
Reform, and note the results year by year, let him
examine the development of the systems of stenography
and their present condition, and he will be at no loss
to find difficulties in the domain of phonetics as applied
to a living language.

But if the obstacles have proven so sar insurmount-
able in a living language, and that, too, our own, who
can affirm with positiveness‚ or consistency even, that,
leaping over centuries, he has discovered the genuine
system of phonetics slumbering in words uttered in the
“ Eternal City‚'’ in her glory? The question Just put
is at least full of suggestions. Brambach is the highest
authority extant on Latin orthography. He, in his in-
troduction to Latin orthography, lays down these
propositions: 1. The orthography of the Silver Age,
when at its highest form-development, is the best model
of modern Latinity. 2. Our Latin forms have been
based on this orthography by older grammarians3 to
think of setting up any other as the standard would*
be a useless experiment. 3. We know of no earlier
period of the Latin tongue so precise in the matter of

forms as that which begins with Nero (Nero reigned .

from 54 to 68 A. D.). 4. The form of the language
from Nero to Adrian (68-117 A. D.) really exhibits
its fullest phonetic development. (Brambach's Orthog-
raphy‚ p. 12) Now let it be granted that the Latin
spelling was phonetic, and then examine the case pre-
sented. l. The age of form-development is after the
Golden A ge, after all the great writers in common use,
except Tacitus. 2. Our Latin orthography is based
on a post-Augustan age. 3. The period of fullest
phonetic development was between Nero and Adrian
(68-117). Necessarily‚ therefore, we have the best
