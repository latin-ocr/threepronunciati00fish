claims to recognition. ⁴

Nom. —“ The University has adopted the following system of
pronunciation [the RomanJ, based upon the investigations of Cors-
sen and other eminent philologists, and now employed in its essen-
tial features in the universities and leading schools of England,
and in Harvard‚ Cornell, and other institutions of this country, as
being proved beyond question a close approximation to the Roman
pronunciation in the time of Cicero.''

The quotation just given is found on page 23 of the Catalogue
of the University of Michigan for 1878-9. It has been repeated for
several years. In view of the state of fact in England in regard to
pronunciation, the quotation contains a statement not a little sur-
prising. For answer to the whole paragraph, reference may be
made to the letters from England, in this work. and also to the
want of harmony among Roman Latinists‚ as already shown. The
Roman mode is practically dead in England.
