THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN. 15

a whole nation in their public affairs, and also exten·
sively in private circlos, even so late as the beginning
of the present century. was quite as peculiar to the
nation in question as any one of the five modern
tongues before mentioned. '
‚Before passing to the next point, let attention be
earefully fixed on several facts in‹'lisputahly settled:
1. That no phase of 1116 Continental system of Eu-
rope professes to be the true ancient pronunciation3
2. That no two of them agree in the sounds of the 0011-
501131115; 3. Τ1131 1116 so-ealled Roman pronunciation
does not agree With a single one of them in either
vowels or 0011501131115,-35, for instance, Cicero, pro-

spoken on 1116 very soil rendered almost sacred 10 1116

5. That when Americans use the Continental they do
not sound the consonants like any uation or tribe on
the continent of Europe. They approximate the vowel
sounds of the Continent, but almost invariably pro-
nounee the consonants as in English. Hence the
so-ealled Continental of Ameriea is a combination of
foreign vowel sounds with eonsonants uttered almost
univeisally as in English words. thatever the theo-
ries of teachers may be, this is 3 stubborn practica]
fact. We have in this country, therefore, 1116 Α11161·1-
can phase of the Continental method, the conglomerate
variety, differing from every other variety of that
