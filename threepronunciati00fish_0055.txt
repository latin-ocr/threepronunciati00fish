THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN. 41

without any evidence on the part of the grammar-iaus
osa desire to change the sound of the 93 e. 9., “ ma-
lignus '' for ‘⁶ maligcnus,'' ‘⁴ gigno ’' for ‘⁴ gigcno,''
‘⁸ tegmen '' for “ tegimen,'' etc.

2. In transcribing from Latin to Greek, and vice versa,
9 is always represented by y, and y by 9.

3. There is no trace to be found in the grammarians
of 9's having any but the one sound in high Latin
times.

4. There is no evidence of 9's having a sound like
the English j, before the fifth century, A. D. At that
time we find ‘⁸ magestates'' written for “majestates”

Take now the discussion of the diphthong oc first
from Roby and then from Blair, in ful] z -

‘⁶ The sound of oe is somewhat perplexing. Mr. Ellis
has suggested (Trans. Phil, Soc. 1867, Supp., p. 65,
and Early Eng. Pro., p. 529) that Greek οἱ was originally
ui with the first element preponderating. Latin 03 was
originally ue with the second clement preponderating.

⁶⁶ This seems possible enough for the Greek, as ο had
frequently that approximation to our u which is here
presented. (See App, A, XII.)

“ But the Latin sound is much more doubtful. It is
true that oe is the successor of Latin οἱ and the repre-
sentative of Greek oi, and that both οἱ and oe passed
frequently into u, e. 9., coirare, coerare, curare3 moe-
rus, murus; moenia, munia; poena, punire, etc.; but
Ι am not aware of any indication that Latin ο had any
such approxiznation to our ης and oe never alternated
with ui. The passage of οἱ and oe into u seems to
imply that at that time the first, not the second, ele-
ment, the o not the i or e, was in the preponderance.

‘⁴ In imperial times oe became confused with e and ae,
