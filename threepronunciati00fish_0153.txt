results. This is true in the domain of thought as well
as in the domain of action. Testing the new system by
this principle, we have to apprehend the most serious
consequences to our own tongue. To sum up: The
English system puts the student in possession of all the
‘proper names, as soon as the quantity of the penult is
known3 makes him master at sight of all the Latin ex-
pressions that have been incorporated into English, and

TION,—a phase of which some of the followers of the
phonetic mode are fully conscious and of which others
seem at least to he wholly unconscious. We mean the
SPELLING REFORM, now so ably advocated by such
scholars as Whitney, of Yale‘College, March, of Lafay-

plete. There is no desire, whatever, to misrepresent
the Spellinq Reform Assocz‘atz‘on‚ and they shall be
allowed to present their own case. Pros. March, the
