All the scholars referred to in these quotations adopt
the Latin method, as does also Prof. Haldeman. These
criticisms, therefore, reveal the lack of uniformity
already noticed.

Here Prof. Haldeman takes to task every gramma-

set forth in detail his views on Roman orthoepy, and,
if he makes any point at all, shows that in some partic-

consumed the time of such a body as the American
Philological Association, by asking attention to mere
shades of diversity that were “insignificant.” The
least that can be said is that there is no phonetic con-

and even if this argument could be established, no liv-
ing man can show that their theoretical phonetics can

trace their pedigree back through seventeen centuries, . -

until the sonnds now called ‘⁶ Latin ’' are in harmony
