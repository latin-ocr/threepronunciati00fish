THE Tuum: PRONUNOIATIONS or LATIN. 33

language of the educated Greeks is not the traditional
language of the Greek nation, for in its present form
it had no existence a century ago. The modern Greek,
properly so called, is in reality the legitimate offspring
of the Byzantine Greek, the last and most corrupt
stage of the common Attio, and however ancient some
of its peculiarities may be, its chief characteristics can-
not be critically traced farther back than the times of
Theodorus Ptochoprodromus (A. D 1150), the first
Romaie author of whom we have any definite accounts.
The modern method began to attraet the attention of
oAmerican scholars upwards of thirty years ago. M uch
has been written in ⁴its favor. In general, however, it
has been treated with contempt or indifference, not, as
one might hastily suppose, because its sounds· are
meagre and effeminate, nor because it is not the pro-
nhunciation of at least four millions of Greeks scattered
all over the East, but simply because its defenders have
failed to establish its claims to classic-al antiquity.''*

Now, even at the risk os a slight repetition, we would
fix attention on the fact that the modern Greeks do not
possess the true ancient pronunciation, according to
Sophocles, himself a modern Greek ; again, that, on the
authority os Profs. Blackie, Kendrick, and others,
the Erasmian is not the classic pronunciation3 and
lastly, that, as shown from the following quotation
from Sophocles, the true ancient pronunciationis not
known and cannot be known, and that too from the
nature of the ease : —

‘⁴ It is conceded that the refinements of the classica]
pronunciation cannot be determined with precision,
partly because they are not minutely described by

* Sophocles.
