THE 'rmum PRONUNOIATIONS or LATIN. 123

under an able toacher, who understands the English
pronunciation of Latin, as he ought, let them study the
grand old language of Cicero, and we shall have
scholars who know how to use their own wonderful lan-
guage. Every lesson the student learns has a reflex
influence on his English. In the so-called Latin mode,
every lesson, every sound, every association leads away
from the vernacular. In a case of this kind the cru-
611116 18 1116 place to test the matter, and the crucible in
this instance is the experience of our ablest and most
successful teachers in the class-room.

Here we are glad to have at hand a letter from the
accomplished scholar and veteran educator, Prof. F. T.
Kemper, of Boonville, Mo, This letter has such 'direct
bearing upon the English method of pronouncing Latin
sor accuracy of English scholarship, as to make any
additional remarks unnecessary under this head.

“ Ι could, under no circumstances, 116 induced 10 611611-
don our accurate· and thorough drill in 1116 English pro-
nunciation of 1116 Latin language‚ though we teach and
value highly the Roman method also. No other exer-
6186 80 fixes the attention of young and thoughtless
minds, and secures such accuracy of mental habits. A
few pages of the Latin Reader, analyzed by the rules for
prolssiunciation, secures the mastery of the subject; and
111611 1116 rules come into 1186 1101 only throughout school
and college life, but in almost every casual conversa-
tion. Why, for example, the first a in Saracen and
sardonyx are pronounced so differently, or the second a
in Samaria and Samaritan, are 11111 specimens of what
is always needed, and what our public speakers often
do not know.''
