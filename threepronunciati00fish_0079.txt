THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS or LATIN. 65

Prof. Twining (ιι Weste1·n‚”July-August, p. 418) at-
tempts ⁴to relieve the want of harmony between Gilder-
sleeve and Blair‚ by saying, ‘⁶ I suspect that Gil-

But why undertake to prove a want of harmony
among those who insist on reform, when the fact is not

the writer last quoted makes this aclmission: ‘⁶ Since

to me to belong to the class of those to be settled by
time, much in the same way as the dispute must be
decided between English and American “ hals? M ake
a note of it that he confesses there is a difficulty to be
settled by time. This is an ingenuous and truthful con-

Latinist in America. There is no escaping it. Our
point is made3 there is a hopeless want of harmony
upon the above issues which are vital to a phonetic sys-
tem. The hope of a future harmony might be allowed
were we dealing with an ideal case, but, unfortunately
for the Romanists‚ our business in this discussion is
with the past‚ to whose crystallized forms no additions
of importance are likely to be made and from whose
dead organisms the vocalization of living utterance has
forever fied. The confusion of those ideal schemes
leaves us in astate of bewilderment from which, it would
