46 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN.

The perplexing and wholly unsatisfactory condition
of the diphthong οε is perfectly obvious from the dis-
cussion represented by Roby and Blair, and no abler
representatives of the subJ'ect can be found.

O and 9 are two letters in regard to which the
reformers seem to think their position impregnable.
Many English Latinists quietly concede the claim. It
would not seem difficult, however, to bring to bear such
proofs as will show that their strongest positions may‘
be even successfully assailed by the most powerful
arguments. thile our view in the mat-ter was in prep-
aration, an article involving these letters, with others,
appeared in the January number (1879) of the “ North
American Review.'' Mr. W. W, Story, in the article
named, presents the point in dispute so admirably and.
ably that we take the liberty of quoting his words. The
new system claims that “ c is always as K? that G is
always as G in get.’' Mr. Story says: -

“We cannot for various reasons think there is any
sufficient wari-ant for such a statement. In the first
place, the letter O is constantly found in old inscrip-
tions, in Greek and Latin, as representing the letter S
or Σ, which would have been quite unnecessary and
misleading if it had the sound of the Greek kappa, or
our Κ . Thus, to mention one of'a thousand instances,
the name of Sardanapalus is inscribed on a statue in

seem to indicate that the G was sounded like S. But
there are other facts and words which more plainly
point to the probability that the modern Italian pronun-

to that of the ancients. In* many words t was used
interchffngeably with c before e and i, showing that the
