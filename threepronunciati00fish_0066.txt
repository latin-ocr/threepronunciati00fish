52 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS oF LATIN.

“It would seem, therefore, all things considered,
that there is not sufficient warrant to overthrow the
present Italian pronunciation of c and 9, as recommended
in the Ooeford and Cambridqe syllabus. Nothing cer-
tainly is gained, variety is sacrificed, and there seems
to be every probability that the traditional pronuncia-
tion is right. At all events, such is the universal pro-
nunciation in the south of Europe.

“ Again, when we consider the large number of pure
Latin words still in constant use in, Italy, without change,
so many of which are names of things and materials
in common use,—words which have been constantly

ter 9 was unknown in Rome for five centuries, and was first intro-
duced into use by the grammarian Spurius Carvilus, in the year
¹ 540 (about 213 Β. 0.). Though this must be a mistake, as it appears
in the Duillian inscription of 494, and also in the epitaph of Scipio
Barbatus, who was consul 111 456, yet it is plain that it must have
been of infrequent use, or he would not have made such a statement.
In macistratus‚ Cartacinensis‚ Leciones, exfociont‚ c and 9 were
apparently equivalents in sound, as they would be if pronounced
as the Italians now pronounce them, the difference being what in
English lies between ‘⁴ chin '’ and “gin.’' Had they pronounced
both these letters hard, they could easily have used the letter Ic
(since they were misspelling these words), which was already in
the alphabet‚ and appears in a bron ze tablet in the Barberini Library
at the date of the beginning of the fourth century of Rome — “sub
aede kastorz’s.'’
Again, in late excavations at Ostia the following inscription was
found of the early Christian times: —

“Loc. Aphrodisias, cum deus permicerit‚
Caelius hic dormit, et Decria, quando deus
Boluerit.'’

From a passage in Ausonius it would even seem that c had more
the sound of s than of lc, for without this pronunciation the J'est
would be lost. Venus says of herself, “ Nata salo, suscepta solo,
patre edita coelo.” If the c be here pronounced as k, the play upon
words is lost. So also ceu, seu, sive, point to this pronunciation.
