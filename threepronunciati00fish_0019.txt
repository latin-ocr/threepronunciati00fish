rrun 'rmum PRONUNCIATIONS' or LATIN. 5

vas-lo. In words of more than two syllables, the Penult,
if lons), is aoeented3 if the Penult is short, the Ante-
penult is accented; as, vnen-‹lzs-cas, ricss-ci-cas, άόῡη’-ῖ-
ηῐιὸ, v5Z‘-2-Z-cris.

There are three exceptions to the rule given:

1. Genitives os the Second Declension in Ξ for ii,
and Vocatives of the same Declension ini for ἱέ, aecent
a short Penult3 as, iwye‘mi for iot-9e¹-nii,· Vir-qiua
fol· Ve'r-in‘-i·‹}.

2. FcZ'-cz‘0 retains its own accent when compounded
with any word except a preposition3 as, com-mowe-
fas-cet.

3. A short final syllable followed by an enelitic
receives the accent3 as, qums-ne. This last exception
applies to all three systems of pronunciation.

Here we must be allowed to dissent from the rule
laid down by nearly all grammarians‚ namely‚ that a
short syllable followed by an enclitic‚ should receive
the accent3 as, primastque. This word would not be
so pronounoed, if simple, and why should it be when
compound? (Roby‚ p. 75 ; also Chap. 13, Book I.)

III. In Latin words, there are as many syllables as
there are separate vowels and diphthongs.

α. A single consonant aster an accented vowel must
be J‘oined to it3 as, qens-wi. This law is universal,
except in the Penult3 aster the vowel u3 and also after
α, e, and o, when these vowels precede a consonant
followed by e, i, or y before another vowel; as, hostum
covi-Sus-Zi-busj clos-ce-0‚ vastelius-tor, pce-tri-us, mli-ne-
[cs-mus. In all these except-mus, a mute with Z or 7·
falls under the same rule as a single consonant; as
Oe-rzo‘-tri-a. In ciba· and sibi the consonant must be

J'oined to the first vowels 3 tib-i, sib-i.
