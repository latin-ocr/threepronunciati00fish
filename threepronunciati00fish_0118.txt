104 THE rmum PRONUNCIATIONS or LA'riN.

SHREWSBURY ScnooL, Jan. 13, 1879.

Ιὶεαν Sir, — The resormed method of Latin pronun-
ciation has been introduced into this school to only a
limited extent. In the sixth -—- our highest form —- the
boys are required to conform to the rules drawn up by
the Latin professore in the universities of Oxsord and
Cambridge, in sayingsstheir repetition Iessons. With
this exception, Latin is pronounced here in the manner
which has so long been usual in English schools. Ι
believe that head masters generally in this country,
although there was some hesitation for a time, have
now acquiesced in the 'continuance of the established
method of pronouncing Latin. For my own part I
should have been glad to comply strictly with the rules
drawn up by the professors of Latin, if other head
masters would have agreed to make the change, and is
tutors and lecturers at Oxford and Cambridge had not
adhered to the received method. In a matter of this
kind, uniformity os practice is obviously desirable.

Believe me, dear sir,
Yonrs very saitlifully,
H. W. Moss.

To the Professor os Latin in the Unam-siey of Missourz'.

P. S. You may make any use of this letter that you
think fit.

OXFORD, ENGLAND, Sept. 3, 1878.

Decio· Sir, — I am ashamed to see that your letter of
the 25th of June, in this year, has been so long neg-
lected. 1 have really nothing to add to my letter of
187 6. The subject of Latin pronunciation has attracted
little attention in England during the two past years.
