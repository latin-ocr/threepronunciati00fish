58 THE THREE PRONUNcrA'rroNs or LATIN.

fate, This is certainly a convenient approximate
sound.

Ξ as z· in machine; ῖ as i in purity. See site in Web-
ster's Unabridged Dictionary.

ὃ as 0 in no. For ὃ Roby gives dot, not, omit.

22 like 00 in moon 3 22 short like u in full.

Y intermediate between i and u. It is French u or
German τὶ (Miiller is nearer Miller than Muller.) For
convenience' sake, then rank y with i.

A short vowel rendered long by position, as for
instance, ἒ in est and esse, is still pronounced short.

Great care should be taken as to final short sylla-
bles; e. 9., “ esse‚'' “amatfir,'' ‘⁶ amatiis.''

Distinguish “ fructfis ’⁹ and ‘⁶ f1·uct[1s.''

DIPHTHONGS.

In all these, each element is heard. Let the combi-
nation be rapid.

ΑΕ or αἱ like ay (yes). In rapid utterance, it is
nearly our persona] pronoun of the first person. ’Σ is a
compound sound made of ah and ee. See Walker’s ,
Dictionary.

αα like ow in now. The analysis is alt-ow. The
rapid combinat-ion is ow in now.

ei as in vein, slightly drawled, and not like the Eng-
lish i in time.

En as elz-00 3 many give the sound of eu in feud.

on or οἱ like the οἱ in oil.

ui like French om] very near our pronoun we.

The American Philological Association recommends
the use of the Italian sounds of the vowels and diph-
thongs.
