62 THE THREE PRONUNOIATIONS oF LATIN.

M arch, the essential idea of a phonetic alphabet3 this,
then, is conceded to be our criterion of J'udgment.
HaIcleman, quoting with approval G. WValker, says:
“ Every letter* retained an invariable sound.'' Quoting
from ScheHer, he says: “The souncl of the long and
short vowels, though elementurz‘ly tlte same, were always
distinguished in length.'' (Halcleman's Latin Pronun-
ciation‚ pp. 17, 19.) 'Allen and Greenough say, “By
the Roman (or phonetic) method, every Zetler has al-
ways the same soundfl (Grammar‚ p. 7.) These are
explicit statements of what is held hythe new ‘⁶ Ro-
mans ’' throughout the world. The vowels did differ in
quantity, they did not differ in quality.
Haldeman holds that: «—

aza in arm. ἐπει in art.
ezey in they. ἐπεὶ in eight.
i=i in marine. 1=i in deceit.
6=o in own. 6=0 in obey.
s1=oo in fool. sr=u in full.

Here, in this ideal scheme, the phonetic theory is
substantially carried out.

Compare with this Tafel's scheme, which is identical‚
at least professedly so, with that of Corssen.

a==a in father. az—-same sound shorter.
ἐπει in fate. ἐπεὶ in then.

i=i in machine. i=i in sit.

6=o in hole. 6=o in nor.

fi=u in rude. u=u in put.

A glauce at this ideal scheme will show that it is not
consistent with the theory in the short sounds of e, i, o,
and u. E in then, i in sit, ο in nor, and u in put have
