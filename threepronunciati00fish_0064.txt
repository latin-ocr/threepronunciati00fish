‘⁶ Here we have the 9 and the 0 113οᾶ interchangeably,
showing that they had nearly the same sound before i.
Either both were hard or both were soft. If both were
hard, then the Italians, as well as the French and
Spaniards, are entirely wrong in their pronunciation of
both letters, and the same incorrectness is to be found
in most of the English words derived from the Latin
in the use of the 9. In fact, all the world is wrong
except 1110 Germans. Is it, however, probable that all
these nations should wrongly pronounce 31] 1110 Latin
words which 31111 exist unchanged in their languages
in which either 0 01· 9 precedes 0 and z· ; and that the
Church carrying 011 daily and continuously its functions
and offices 111 Latin for eighteen centuries, should have
assumed a totally new and false pronunciation?

‘⁶ If this be the case, what is to be made of the ob-
servation of Quintilian, “Cum Ο 30 311111111101 G non
valuerunt 111 Τ 30 D, molliuntur3 ne illas quidem circa
S literam delitias [which, be it observed, he spells
delitias] hic magister feret''? (Inst., lib. i., cap. 11.)

*³ Other examples are to be found in tho royal edicts where 9
and 0 are used interchangeably, as having the same force. Thus,
agnum is spelled acnum3 agrum, acrum, etc.
