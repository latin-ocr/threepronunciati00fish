THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN. 127

does not the writer know that all these Greek proper
names in our lexicons are pronounced universally and
invariably, in both England and America, according to
the old-sashioned English? No one can believe that these
able Roman Latinists have allowed the fact here alluded
to to escape them. And yet the quotation above might
lead a student to suppose that these Greek names were
pronounced aster the method of pronouncing Greek
now commonly received in this country. We mean
the Erasmian. The truth is that not a single proper

name in Webster or VVorcester is pronounced accord· ⁶

ing to the Erasinian mode, not one. All suchreplies
simply reveal the weakness of the cause they are (le-
signed to strengthen. As an illustration, take AE-ga-
tes, AE-gis-thus, Delphi, Theophrastus, Thermopylae,
and Scythopolis. These names are pronounced E-qszs-tez,

and Scy-tlz5p‘-5-li3, according to the English method.
And so of the rest.

Again, the author of the quotation makes the wholly
gratuitous assumption that “ probably not two hundred ''
of those names are of frequent occurrence. Will it not
be hard to induce a thorough scholar, who has taken
anything like a thorough course in our best schools, to
believe that only two hundred names out of a list of over
twenty thousand are of importance on account of fre-
quency? One hour’s work in VVebster’s Dictionary, by
one who is conversant with the classic tongues, will dis-
sipate quite effectually all such arguments. There are
over fifty proper names on the very first page of Web-
ster that are of decided importance to our college classeS.
But even if comparatively few were of frequent occur-
rence, we insist that 311 accurate knowledge of the
