Tm: THREE PRONUNCIAT10NS oF LATIN. 23

The difficulty here is scen and felt and confessed by
scholars whose vast researehes in the field of philology
in the last twenty-five years have been simply amaziug,
and have crowned with honor the countries to which
they belong. Fortunately there is in the Hebrew lan-
guage a ready and vivid illustration of the obstacles to
be overcome in deterinining the true pronunciation of
an ancient language. Jews and Christiane, of all
names and all shades of belief, have stood as sleepless
sentinels over this tongue of the old prophets for over
eighteen centuries. But what is true to-day? There
¹ are three distinct systems of pronunciation now current
among the Jews themselves, to say nothing 'of Gentile
nations. These are the Polish, German, and Portu·
guese methods. Dr. Alexander Meyrowitz,÷¹÷ of the
University of Missouri, a J ew, and one of the greatest
Hebrew and Rabbinical scholars now living, lays down
these systems in the Preface to his Hebrew Grammar.
Look at the illustration thus afforded. The Hebrew
has for thousands of years been a spoken and living
language. It is so to-day. The Jews, over seven
millions in number, are found in every nation under
heaven, clinging, too, with startling tenacity‚ to the
customs‚ traditions, sacred books, and language of their
fathers. In the fifth century, or at the latest in the
seventh, Jewish scholars invented the vowel points to
avoi( “losing the correct pronunciation.” (Conant's
Gesenius, p. 38.) Further still. Alongside the Hebrew
stands its cognate, the ArabIe, a tongue spoken by
hundreds os millions for untold generations. The Jews

* Dr. Meyrowitz speaks Hebrew as we speak English, and
is called among the Jews the ‘⁶ Hebrew Horace.''
