64 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS oF LATIN.

or e in met, still more prolonged than e in tres. He
speaks of fate as being “ a convenient approximate
·sound.'' In his “Internati011al,'' published in Decem-
ber, 1877, he gives e long=a in fate. Now we confess
our utter inability to understand how this able scholar,
by the prolongation of the' sound of e in met, to any
extent, can reach as a result α in fate. Any one can
test the matter by bringing to bear the organs of speech
on the production of the two sounds. Before the
speaker, when sounding e in met, can produce the sound
of α in fate, he must stop and readJust the organs. The
trial will make manifest the truth that there is not only
a readJustment, but also a tension of the organs de-
cidedly greater in sounding our genuine long α, which
almost all the Romans make the representative of the
long e, in their system. It is difficult to escape from
the conclusion that Prof. Richardson's mind undero
went a change between October, 1876, and December,
1877, not only in reference to the long e, but also in
other particulars, as we may show hereafter.

But to descend more to particulars, take the diph-
thong AE.

Roby says oe=a in bat (lengthened), or bath.
Blair says oe=cn⁸ in Zair, or α in late.

Harkness says, oe=aye=English i.
Gildersleeve say& oe=oe in Graeme=ct infame.

That the vowel sounds as heard in bat, late, and aye=23
long, are not the same, is simply beyond all controversy.
We venture the assertion that no scholar, unless a for-
eigner, who looks at the case calmly, will risk his repu-

, tation as an orthoepist by affirming that these words do
contain the same sound.
