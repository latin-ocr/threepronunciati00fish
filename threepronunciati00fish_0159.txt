THE 'rmum PRONUNCIArtoNs oF LATIN. 145

When we look at the influenee of the new mode on the
English tongue, it is positively injurious, as has been
already seen. Viewed in relation to the languages of
modern Europe, it does not possess a tithe of the value
claimed for it by its friends. What are the facts?
Most students in England and America study Latin sor
the culture it yields and for its refiex influence on their
native language which has levied such immense con-
tributions on the Latin within the past fifty years.
Comparative philology is not thought of by the vast
majority of students. They have no time for it, and
hence every moment spent in learning a system because
it is held to be valuable in this inviting field is simply ·
lost by nearly all English-speaking students. Of the
five hundred students in Missouri Universityq how many
will devote themselves to philology? Perhaps not. ten,
perhaps not five, perhaps not two 3—-of the sixty thou-
sand students in the colleges in the United States and
British Possessions‚ not including Catholic institutions
whose statistics are not at hand, how many will devote
themselves to philological research‘? Take Harvard Uni-
versity‚ or Yale, or Miehigan‚ and statisties show that
comparatively few ever devote themselves directly to a
comparison of the languages of the earth. Granting
what is claimed by the phonetie method in the direction
named, would its advocates have our students waste
their time in learning a mode that will benefit not five
pupils out of a hundred? Shall one hundred boys be
compelled to sacrifice their English scholarship and
waste their time for a certain benefit that may or may
not acerue to five of their number? If any one has a
taste for comparative philology‚ and the hard mode of

pronouneing Latin does give aid, then let him learn it.
