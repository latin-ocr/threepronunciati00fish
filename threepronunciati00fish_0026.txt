12 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN.

consonants with semi-Italian vowel sounds.

“ Either the English or the new ⁶ Roman ' is consis-
tent with itself, no other that ever I heard from an
American is. An Italian, a Frenchman, etc., is consis-
tent when 116 pronounces Latin, because 116 does it like
his own.

“WVhen the Catholic clergy became illiterate in the
Middle Ages, they learned to read their prayer-book with
the pronunciation each of his own nation, and so each
country got to pronouncing Latin as it did its own

from each other in pronunciation less than they do from
English, an English or an American ear does not read-

Continental, but the Vatican council settled that.’'
