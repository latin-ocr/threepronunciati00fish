THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN. 37

“ With a view to distinguish the usage of these
writers in the matter of pronunciation and orthography,
we may divide them into three-groups.

‘⁴ To the first and oldest group belong Cicero, Caesar,
and Sallust. Of these, Sallust has a marked fondness
sor long-established forms, while Caesar lends a very
ready ear to the pronunciation Just coming into fashion,
and in so far as his philological studies allow it to
