124 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN.

nearly forty years, and is, in the West, what Phillips
Academy is in N ew England. More accurate training
is not found in America. The experience os this able
teacher corresponds with that of Arnold, of Rugby,
and of the accomplished J ex-Blake,- who now fills
Arnold’s place. Acouracy in English is in value above
rubies, and is seldom attained. Many who have taught
the English method have evidently never mastered the
subject. For example, a writer in the “ New England
Journal of Education,'' for Dec. 26, 1878, uses this
sentence : “⁵Again, diphthongs are long in quantity,
but the genitive of Caesar we 6611 Caesaris (Sezaris).''
He gives the s the z sound 111 611 oblique case. Does it
not· have the hissing sound in the oblique cases? Do
not the authorities say so? So we think. How many
teachers can give the reason why a in Saracen and sar-
donyx are not alike? How many 6611 1611 why α 111
Samaria differs from a in Samaritam? Such examples
are of constant recurrence, and while the student learns
carefully the English mode, he at the same time learns
the more elegant way to pronounce his own language.
Mark you, the English system, at 1116 561116 111116 1116
61655 learns to pronounce Latin, gives as a necessary
consequence the most valuable aid in etymology, and
also in English orthoepy. Hence the English method
economizes time, while the so-called Roman mode kills
the time, sacrifices· the etymology, and completely
revolutionizes the orthoepy.

We hear frequently from our best educated public
speakers and from many a teacher’s desk mistakes which
a rigid drilling in the use of the English pronunciation
would have prevented. Thus derivation, meaning, and
pronunciation favor decidedly the system that has been
employed in England since the reign of Elizabeth.
