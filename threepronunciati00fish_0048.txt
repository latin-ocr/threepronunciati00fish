34 ΤΗΕ THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN.

ancient grammarians, but chiefly because the vanishing
or obscure sounds of all languages are always perplex-
ing to foreigners. And it must not be forgotten that
all modern nations are, with respect to the ancients,
foreigners.'' (Sophocles' Alphabet and Pronunciation,
pp. 7, 8, 10.)

Bullions' Greek Grammar by Kendrick, an ardent
advocate of the Erasmian system, virtually yields the
point that we do not know the ancient pronunciation.
On page 4 occurs the following passage : —

“ The ancient pronunciation of the Greek vowels and
diphthongs cannot now be determined with certainty in-
all caseS. The knowledge we have of it is ⁷derived
chiefly from Greek words that appear in Latin and
Latin words that appear in Greek. from imitation of
natural sounds,' as the bleating of sheep or the barking
of the dog; from a play upon words, and other sim-
ilar hints. Valuable aid may be derived from the pro-
nunciation of the modern Greek, and a study of the
euphonic laws which have produced it.

“ If uniformity in the pronunciation of the Greek is to
be aimed at,-and it is certainly desirable that it
should, —the Erasmian method, among all others now
in use, seems entitled to preference, on account of its
simplicity and perspicuity, and as having largely in its
favor the authority of the ancients. It is the pronun-
ciation mainly prevalent in Europe, and to a considera-
ble extent in America.”

It is well known by scholars that Sophocles, Packard,
Curtius, and K'uhner, not to mention others, do not
yet agree as to the sounds of some of the diphthongs.
Erasmus never claimed anything more than that the
system indicated i n thc dialogue was an approximation
to the ancient pronunciation.
