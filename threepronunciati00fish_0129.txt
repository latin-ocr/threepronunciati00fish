THE Tumm PRONUNCIATIONS OF m'rm. .‘ 115 ⁰

700 ; pro, 6003 per, 350. From the single root fac we
have about 004 derivativcs, according to Prof. IIaldc-
man. (See his “ Affixes‚'' pp. 14-16.)

The author last quoted is of the opinion that there
are not three hundred roots in any language. (‘· AffixeS‚''
p. 13.) In view of the fact that such a vast ma-
jority of our words are from the Latin, either mediately
or immediately, in view of the fact that of these three
hundred stems very many are from the same classic
tongue‚ we are vitally interested in recognizing the
prefixes and stems which make„ our English what it is.
It matters not whether the English system of pronoun-
cing Latin has been used one hundred years, three hun-
dred years, or one thousand years: what we are con-
cerned with is that the English language as it is now
stands has been founded on the old-fashioned pronun-
ciation of Latin. This is indisputably true. Philo-
logic and antiquarian research is one thing3 the pro-
gress of a language, like that os nations‚ is quite a dif-
ferentthing.

For centuries the Latin has been making its rich
contributions to our noble English. These additions
to our language are being made to-day, as they will be
made in the future, and that from necessity. One thing
of inestimable value to every student is a thorough
knowledge of his mother tongue, — a matter sadly neg-
lected in many of our colleges and universities.

The question for English-speaking people to settle is
as to which pronunciation leads most directly to a vig-
orous and thorough use of our mother tongue. We
answer unhesitatingly‚ the English. Let us have one
thing at a time. The bearing of the new pronuncia-
tion on comparative philology will receive due attention
