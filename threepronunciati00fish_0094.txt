80 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN.

‘⁴ The slumbrous wave outwelleth‚
Ze slombroos vav oozvelless,

“ The babbling runnel crispeth,
Ze babblanq ronnel crees-pass,

“ The hollow grot replieth‚
Ze ollcv {froc reples-ess,

“Where Clarihel low lieth. ’
Vere Glaribel lovlee-ess.”

These articles of Mr. Tetlow have been written with-
in two months past3 they present the new system in
its most plausible phase and furnish us, in 'the quota-
tions made, an answer to Prof. Haldeman’s plea sor the
new system, that leaves nothing to be desired in addi-
tion. A Frenchman can’t learn English from books,
ancl especially its phonetics; an American can't learn
French from books; and no man living can learn the
phonetics of the ancient Latin from books. If not
from boola, where is he to go? Let some N ew ‘⁶ Ro-
man ” tell us.

Take one more illustration. Prof. W. G. Richard-·
son, under date of May 3, in the “Columbia States-
man‚'' says: “ Prof. Leonard must anglicize his speech
to com-ment vowss por-tez vowss. . . . I have
a literary friend who actually pronounces thus. He
learned ‘ French without a master.⁷ Fortunately he is
very cleas ancl knows little of the effect of his peculiar
phonetics.’' The reformers are thoronghly sonnd when
they handle any other language than the Latin. The
two illustrations Just made exhibit vividly how near we

can approach the phonetics of a language from books
alone. ’
