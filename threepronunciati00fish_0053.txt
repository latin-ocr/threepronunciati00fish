must necessarily have been changed, as in “ audacter ''
for ‘· audaciter.'' This would have taken place, too,
in an enormously large number of other words3 c. 9.,
difficulter and diflicile3 capio and cepi; cano and
cecini; acer and acris; locus and loci3 lacus and laci,
with the two datives lacibus and lacubus3 piscis and
piscosus, etc.

2. Quintilian says (Ι. 7, 10), “ Κ quidem in nullis
verbis utendum puto, nisi quae significat, etiam ut sola
ponatur. Hoc eo non omisi, quod quidam eam, quo-
tiens A sequatur, necessariam credunt, cum sit C
littera, quae ad omnes vocales vim suam perferat?
K, we know, was used in certain word, as Kalends,
Karthago, etc. Now there was a very animated dis-
cussion among grammarians in Quintilian’s time, as to
whether the Roman alphabet needed more letters or
already had too many. Vide Quint„ Ι. 4, 7-9. He
there instances k and q.

Terent. Maurus (about 300 A. D.) speaks also
about these letters, and says that k and q are both use-
less, since lc, q, or c can be used after any vowel with
the same sound. (VsS. 204-2(›9) . I quote merely the
last line, “refert nihilum, k prior an q siet an c.''
Again, Priscian (I. page 12) says, “lc enim et q,
quamvis figura et nomine videantur aliquam habere dif-
ferentiam, cum c tamen eadem tam in sono vocum
quam in metio potestatem continent.⁷'

3. In transcribing Greek and Latin words kappa is
always written sor ο, and vice versa ,· whereas, in some
words, as Cicero, for instance, would have been much
nearer the sound, if c had been pronounced soft3 or in
many instances could have been used as in the above
example of Cicero.
