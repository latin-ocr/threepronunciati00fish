144 THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LA'rm.

at last. Appeal to practice, far more valuable in such
a case than abstract discussion. Charles B. Scott,
head master of the famous St. Peter's College‚ West-
minster, England, whose letter has been given in chap-
ter five, says, “In some [schools], no doubt, the
change has been more or less successfully made, but
we found the waste of time involved in correcting mis-
pronunciation to be fatal. It is hard enough to teaeh
the various subjects required in the hours which are
available, and if the Latin hours are to be spent in
mere vocal exercise, the language can never be learnt in
the time, nor the author studied. The change has
little value for mere boys.'' But, say the reformers,
the system is quite easy3 the vowels differ only in
quantity, not in quality, of sound, and these sounds are
quickly learned by the average boys3 the consonants,
with about seven exceptions, are like the English. A
conspectus of the new system looks very easy indeed3
but it should be remembered that these boys, to be
accurate iu the ‘⁶ Roman '² in practice, must revolution-
ize their organs of speech and pronounce the vowels
and several of the consonants in a way totally different
from that to which they have been accustomed from
childhood. Lip habits, like all others, are changed
with extreme difficulty and after much time has been
spent. Even then many of our Latinists, when the
test comeS, may say sebboleth instead of slzibboleth.

In this age, American and English boys have no
time to waste on foreign sounds in uttering Latin,
especially when there is a scholarly pronunciation
familiar to them already.

ance their system gives in COMPARATIVE PHILOLOGY.
