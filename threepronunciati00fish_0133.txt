THE 'mnus Pnouuncmrtous or LATIN. 119

Against the argument now under discussion in behalf
of the English system, Mr. Tctlow urges : —-

“ Seconclly, etymologies of this kind are so obvious,
from the twofold identity of form and sound, that they
are wholly devoid of interest. They require so little
ingenuity on the part of the student, as to be valueless
for purposes of philological training. They do not dis-
cipline thermind to the quick recognition of kinship in
words that have undergone changes of form. What
school-boy, for example, does not find his curiosity more

the English wine, and the French vin?

· This quotation brings to the surface the constantly
recurring fact, that the reformers forever, in the defence
of their theory, turn to comparative philology. Well
they may, for the “ Roman ’' sicle, if it has any virtue
at all, can lay no claim to assistance in English etymol-

tinct from that which enables the pupil to appreciate
the relationship of such forms as the Greek< οἶνος, the
Latin vinum, the English wine, and the F rench vinss'
Indeed it is different, and the difference is founded
largely in the plain home-truth that to see the relation
readily between our own words and the parent Latin is
of first and vital importance. Telling a class that com-
