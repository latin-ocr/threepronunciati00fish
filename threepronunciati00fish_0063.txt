THE THREE PRONUNCIATIONS OF LATIN. 49

Again, not only in names, but in almost if not all other
words of Latin derivation, in which ᾳ] precedes c and i,
it has the same soft pronunciation. Gentilis is gentil
in French, gentle in English, and gentile in Italian.
So also geniUS, gemma, generatiO, germen, gestatio,
may be adduced. But it is useless to multiply exam-
ples3 they will occur to every one. Is it in any way
probable that all the Romance nations, whose languages
are derived from the Latin, are utterly wrong in their
pronunciation, and that the Germans (or the &her-mans,
if they are right in the sound of the 9) have prescived
its true pronunciation. ‘²

⁷ “ Let us go further. Undoubtedly 111 ancient inscrip-
tions we find the 9 and the c before e andi used indiffer-
ently. A clear proof of this is to be found in the
inscription of Duilius, A. U. C. 493, at Rome. This
was engraved on the base of the Columna Rostrata,
raised to celebrate the first naval victory over the
Carthaginians, and which was struck down by lightning
between the second and third Punic wars, and remained
buried in the ruins of Rome until it was unearthed in
1565 near the Capitol. Though considerably defaced
in parts, it was legible, and has been carefully restored
by learned hands. It is as follows ε -
