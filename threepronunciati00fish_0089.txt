Tm: 'mmm PRONUNCIATIONS or LATm. 75

now offered for acceptance, is not to be charged with
all the diversities which appeared when the views of ·
scholam-were crude and tentative.’' Snrely a comp
cle arctoe that, and from a Romanist too. Hear him
-further: ‘⁶ Ten years ago Prof. Thaeher might call at-
tention to the Tafel scheme of pronunciation, as com-
pared with that of J. F. Richards0n3 it is rather late
to reproduce the comparison to—day.'' Look at it.
Richardson, wrote in 18593 Tafel‚ in 18603 their
schemes played havoe with one another. But, says
Prof. Twining, the system “as now offered for ac-
ceptance '' is not to be charged with their ⁶‘ diversitieS,’'
their views were ‘⁴ cvude'’ and “ tentative.’' ‘⁶ Tem-
pora mutantur et in illis mutamur.’' This again is a
confession of what we have in hand, — a notorious want
of harmony. This is not all yet. W. G. Richardson‚
one of the best informed Roman Latinists in the world,
in the spring of 1878, in a letter now in hand, uses these
words : “ J. F. Richardson's little book was the last ounee
that broke the camel’s back.” He is speaking of his
change from the English to the “ Roman '' method. He
does not consider J. F. Richardson’s work “ crude ” and
“tentative.'' On the other hand, it was the very in-
strument used in his phonetic conversi0n3 “it broke
the eamel's bael{.''' It is noteworthy here that two
able advocates of the same mode put a totally different
estimate on their pioneer writers. According to one,
these writers are entitled to the highest consideration3
the other would have us believe that their diversities
are not to be charged home on the system as now
offered. ‘⁴ Sul) judice lis est.''

In the light of the preceding facts, we can see how
much credenee is to be extended to an assertion often
